member of russias intelligence agency in exchange for an undisclosed amount of cashthe arrest is the latest in a spate of detentions as german authorities move against russian agents germanys domestic intelligence service has grown increasingly concerned that moscow is stepping up its efforts to win over western collaborators to gain information about the countrys economic political and strategic positions as well as those of the european unionmuch of the focus has been on the threat of cyberespionage after hackers linked to russia were suspected of breaching the german governments main data network and the countrys parliament but experts in germany say that moscow is again employing oldfashioned human contact to gather intelligencegiven its prominent role as europes largest economy germany has become an interesting target for espionage by agents from russia as well as china turkey and iran the authorities saythomas haldenwang who heads germanys domestic intelligence agency told parliament last year that the level of espionage had reached if not exceeded the levels during the cold war when a divided germany was at the forefront of a geopolitical divide between the usled

satisfied  error russia end of the road for those seeking to exercise their right to protest  amnesty international russia end of the road for those seeking to exercise their right to protestauthorities in russia have eroded the right to freedom of peaceful assembly by using increasingly restrictive laws and heavyhanded police tactics and criminal prosecutions to silence peaceful dissent  to the point where it is almost impossible for russians to protest in any meaningful way amnesty international said in a new briefing todayin russia no place for protest the organization documents how the clampdown on peaceful protests which began with the  federal law on assemblies has accelerated in recent years via a succession of legislative amendments and their ever more selective and restrictive application as a result there now exists a plethora of legal restrictions on when where how for what purpose and by whom the right to take to the streets can be exercisedrussian authorities have been curtailing the right to freedom of assembly with incredible persistence and inventiveness for years no other issue has been given so much energy at every level of power as a result peaceful street protest has come to be seen as a crime by state officials – and an act of heroism by those russians who still believe it is their right to exercise it said oleg kozlovsky amnesty internationals russia researcherthe unlawful restrictions requirements and harsh sanctions that russian protesters face can only be described as kafkaesque in their absurdity it has taken the russian authorities  years and  instances of parliamentary tinkering with legislation to make the right to freedom of peaceful assembly devoid of any genuine meaningnine out of the  major legislative amendments that have been used to curtail the right to freedom of peaceful assembly in russia have been introduced since  as part of a crackdown on antigovernment protests and human rights guaranteed by the international human rights law and russias own constitutionlocal authorities have followed the trend set by federal legislation and introduced new restrictions on peaceful assembly these changes have emboldened both the police and criminal justice system with police officers using increasingly heavyhanded tactics to silence peaceful protesters and the courts handing down severe penalties against themlegal restrictions on public assembliesrequirements for protest have become lengthy and ever more restrictive under the law in its current form for example people pronounced guilty of crimes against the constitutional order state security social safety or social order or of protestrelated administrative offences more than once in  consecutive months are barred from organizing any public gatheringunder federallevel regulations assemblies cannot take place near courthouses prisons presidential residences and since december  emergency services but regional legislation makes these restrictions even more drastic in kirov oblast for instance the local law prohibits any gatherings near cultural educational medical or entertainment facilities shopping centres playgrounds and even public transport stops – in effect virtually anywhere in towns spontaneous that is unplanned assemblies are universally forbidden and are dispersed with excessive force when they occursince december  foreign citizens foreign and international organizations as well as russian nationals and ngos labelled foreign agents by the authorities are barred from financing public gatherings in addition assemblies of more than  participants must be organized and funded using a designated bank account or else they become illegalorganizers of almost all types of protests must submit prior notification to the authoritiesthe ‘prior notification procedures are routinely used by the authorities to limit under a variety of pretexts the number of participants in a gathering move it to a sparsely populated part of a city or ban it altogether moreover under legislative amendments passed in  the authorities have obtained the power to ‘recall permissions under vaguely worded and unsubstantiated pretexts such as a ‘real threat of ‘an emergency or a terrorist attack said oleg kozlovskyhefty fines administrative detention and criminal prosecution of peaceful protestersover the years the code of administrative offences and the criminal code have been drastically expanded with provisions restricting the rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly as well as the imposition of harsher sanctions for various purported offencessince  the number of specific legally defined violations of the law on assemblies has risen from three to  the maximum fines have soared from  rubles us in  to  us in  and administrative detention for up to  days was introduced as a possible penalty for  out of these  offencesthe single most repressive measure was the introduction in  of criminal liability with a penalty of up to five years imprisonment for repeated violations of the law on assemblies under the infamous dadins article  of the criminal codebesides being criminalized for exercising their right to peaceful protest detained protesters in russia are also subjected to unfair almost parody trials sometimes taking as little as five minutes with no key witnesses summoned and the truthfulness of police reports accepted unquestioningly said oleg kozlovskyexcessive use of forcethe briefing also details the excessive use of force by police officers who have been documented using martial arts techniques against protesters battering them mercilessly with batons and beginning this year stunning them with electroshock weaponsdespite widespread public outcry over cases of excessive use of force by the police like the january  case of margarita yudina  a peaceful protester who ended up in an intensive care unit after being kicked in the stomach by a riot police officer  the authorities either do not take action to investigate and bring suspected perpetrators to justice or they manifestly derail such investigations which reinforces the climate of impunityit sends a clear signal to the police force that any excesses are tolerable that violence is encouraged and full impunity guaranteed said oleg kozlovskycalls for comprehensive reform of legislation on assembliesamnesty international is calling for the russian authorities to reform national legislation and practices to bring them in line with the countrys constitution and international human rights obligations the authorities must prohibit measures that change the aims or place of public gatherings as well as the number of permitted participants unless such decisions are taken in judicial proceedingsthe authorities must also respect spontaneous peaceful assemblies – which should be considered lawful when submission of a notification within the period prescribed by law is impossible or impracticalnext months parliamentary elections give russia the opportunity to change its approach to commit to promotion and protection of human rights including the right to freedom of peaceful assembly we want to remind candidates for elections and future legislators that the right to protest peacefully is not something they can give or take away it is something everyone is entitled to and the government should respect protect and promote this and devote its energy to ensuring not undermining this right said oleg kozlovskyrelated contentrussian federationstand with belarusiran security

national defense strategy recognizes as nearpeer competitors to the united states theyre already collaborating on research both are run by autocratic regimes and neither has much affinity for the united states but the marriage may not be as steady as russia especially would like others to believe a new report out of russia accuses the chinese government of hacking russian state targetslast week the groupibsecurity consulting group published a blog post describing attacks in  against russian federal executive authorities the attacks continued into the malware used in the attack webdavo bears an uncanny resemblance to code that certain chinese hacker groups use according to groupib which was founded in russia but now has offices in other countriesgroupib specialists established that webdavo has a set of commands similar to a popular trojan called bluetraveller aka remshell which was developed in china and has been linked to the hacker group called taskmasters the report saida second chinese attacker group ta also hit russian executive authorities in groupib experts believe that either both chinese hacker groups ta and taskmasters attacked russian federal executive authorities in  or that there is one united chinese hacker group made up of different units the group writesthat matters because western military leaders have become increasingly concerned about growing ties between the two regimes a nato communiqué from june noted that china is also cooperating militarily with russia including through participation in russian exercises in the euroatlantic areachina and russia are also cooperating on space initiatives to challenge the united states and a wide variety of technology pursuits but many experts describe the budding relationship as a mostly cosmetic alliance one that benefits moscow far more than beijing as china grows in power russia could become more eager to claim their relationship with china is healthy and growing especially around technologychineserussian defense cooperation has generated significantly greater gains for china than it has for russia over time moscow is poised to grow more dependent on beijing as long as its standoff with nato continues eugene rummer and richard sokolsky wrote in a carnegie endowment oped in juneanother russia watcher sam bendett said officials in moscow had deliberately downplayed knowledge of chinese hackssince sinorussian high tech cooperation is elevated to the highest levels with leaders of both countries publicly promoting such bilateral activity any discussion of potential chinese hacking against russia was a ‘third rail there were few if any public admissions of confirmation that such antirussian activities are taking place said bendett a cna adviser and an adjunct senior fellow at the center for a new american security so if these allegations are true and the chinese hackers were indeed statebacked it shows the difficulty of trying to preserve sinorussian hightech cooperation as above the hacking that is supposed to be done by russias ‘traditional cyber adversaries that are constantly singled out by moscow ie us and natowhen asked for his opinion on the report dmitri alperovitch cofounder and former chief technology officer of cybersecurity company crowdstrike said that russia is waking up to the fact that china has been hacking the

exercise in northwestern china this week has highlighted beijings and moscows shared concern over violence spilling over fromafghanistanoften regarded as economic rivals in central asia the prospect of extremist groups gaining a foothold on their doorsteps is bringingchina and russia closer together experts say some suggestthat a central asian security crisis could even prompt joint military intervention though others suspectsuch a partnership might quickly revert to competitionover  troops from both countries are currently deployedto chinas ningxia hui autonomous region alongwith a large number of artillery pieces aircraftand armored vehicles as part of the exercise chinese and russian soldiers are rehearsing firing thousands of artillery shells at enemy targets sending a fighter jet squadron on a joint bombing missionand launching a ground assaultagainst hostile positionsa statement issued by the russian ministry of defense emphasized that the exercise demonstrated the determination and ability of russia and china to fight terrorism and jointly protect peace and stability in the regionthe drills come amid a taliban offensive in northern afghanistan that has seen the group capture at least nine provincial capitals over the past week the taliban havemade significant territorial gains since the us began withdrawing its troops from the countryin may according to some estimates the taliban now controlover half of afghanistans  districts more than doublewhat they held just a few months agothe worry in beijing and moscow is that the violence could soon reach other central asian countriesin another sign of growing alarm this week russia has also been conducting joint exercises with uzbekistan and tajikistan near the tajikafghan border russian media on wednesday said taliban militants have seized control of afghanistans borders with the two central asian statesciting defense minister sergei shoigu reuters reportedboth china and russia have significant economic interests in central asia russia has actively recruited regional states for its eurasian economic union trade bloc while china has heavily invested in infrastructure projects in the region as part of its belt and road initiative but while they both want influence the crisis in afghanistan ispushing any disagreements to the side according to vasily kashin a senior research fellow at the russian academy of sciences institute of far eastern studiesrussia and china have a common interest in regional stability which outweighs any economic consideration he said neither country wants to see central asia become destabilized or have the united states establish a military presence thereon july  chinese defense minister wei fenghe met with his russian counterpart shoigu in dushanbe tajikistan to discuss the changing conditions in afghanistan and central asia the two defense ministers vowed to coordinate their efforts to maintain regional peace and stabilityfollowing the current round of drills this week moscow and beijing will hold another counterterrorism exercise in midseptember in russias orenburg region the next roundwill feature over  troops and is set to take place under the auspices of the shanghai cooperation organization a eurasian security alliance led by the two powersif the situation in afghanistan continues to worsen however kashin said beijing and moscow may start exploring more drastic action he saidthat if afghanistan turns into a launching pad for attacks into central asia then china and russia could very well launch a joint military intervention to eliminate that threatif it becomes necessary to stabilize afghanistan or the neighboring territories then we will see the formation of a coalition under the leadership of russia and china he predicted no one will want to act alone under such difficult circumstanceskashin argued that in the event of a central asian crisis china and russiawould have little choice but to rely on each other on one hand the russian armed forces could help compensate for the chinese peoples liberation armys lack of recent battlefield experience at the same time china could help russia cover the financial costs of a major military campaignthe two militariesalready have some experience working together china and russia have conducted regular joint land sea and air exercises since  many of these drills have centered onscenarios in which chinese and russian troops staged a mock invasion of a territory captured by terroriststhat experience could prove decisive in the event that moscow and beijing decide to launch a joint operation in central asia said viktor murakhovsky editorinchief of the influential russian defense journal arsenal of the fatherlandmurakhovsky explained that years of training had provided chinese and russian forces with ample experience of working together in coalition groupings  military formations in which one countrys troops operate under anotherscommand staffthis is the only effective way to conduct joint military operations he said if creating such coalition groupings is not an option for political or military reasons then successfully executing a joint military operation becomes highly problematicyet despite the strong political and military synergy between beijing and moscow some experts caution that the two sides could run into serious disagreements as the situation in afghanistan continues to unfoldandrei serenko head of the center for the study of modern afghanistan said that for the time being neither the taliban nor the government in kabul wasin a position to attain a decisive military victory such an unstable balance of power in afghanistan he argued is conducive to cooperation between china and russia since it presentsboth countries with an imminent threat the creation of a sanctuary for extremist groups looking to target central asiabut if at some point in the near future that dynamic changes  for example if one of the sides appears on the brink of victory or a new external actor enters the conflict  then we could see a battle for influence within afghanistan in which russia and china find themselves backing different factions serenko saidunder that scenario we could very well see a situation where moscow and beijing become competitors if not rivals in a political game in afghanistansign up to our

could only have come from russian army suppliesrussia denies any links to wagnerthe group was first identified in  when it was backing prorussian separatists in the conflict in eastern ukraine since then it has been involved in regions including syria mozambique sudan and the central african republic wagners fighters appeared in libya in april  when they joined the forces of a rebel general khalifa haftar after he launched an attack on the unbacked government in the capital tripoli the conflict ended in a ceasefire in october the group is notoriously secretive but the bbc has managed to gain rare access to two former fighters they revealed what type of person was joining wagner  and its lack of any code of conductthere is little doubt that they kill prisoners  something one exfighter freely admits noone wants an extra mouth to feedthis supports other parts of the tv documentary  haftars russian mercenaries inside the wagner group  by bbc news arabic and bbc news russian its other revelations include evidence of suspected war crimes including the intentional killing of civiliansone libyan villager describes how he played dead as his relatives were killed his testimony helped the bbc team identify a suspected killerdescribing another possible war crime a libyan government soldier also recalls how a comrade his friend surrendered to wagner fighters but was shot twice in the

libyan military prosecutors office mohamed gharouda announced that an arrest warrant had been issued for the son of late libyan leader muammar gaddafiaccording to the order which was released internally last week saif alislam gaddafi is wanted on charges of war crimes committed by the group during gen haftars offensive against the capital tripolihe was arrested during the  uprising in libya and later sentenced to death in absentia over violence against protesters in  however he was released by the militia holding himsaif alislam has long been suspected of having connections to russia and the wagner group and is believed to be moscows favourite candidate to rule libya the tablet was left behind by an unknown wagner fighter after the groups fighters retreated from areas south of tripoli in spring  its contents include maps in russian of the frontline giving confirmation of wagners significant presence and an unprecedented insight into the groups operations  there is drone footage and codenames of wagner fighters at least one of whom the bbc believes it has identified the tablet is now in a secure locationa comprehensive list of weapons and military equipment is included in a page document dated  january  given to the bbc by a libyan intelligence source and probably recovered from a wagner locationthe document indicates who may be funding and backing the operation it lists materiel needed for the completion of military objectives  including four tanks hundreds of kalashnikov rifles and a stateoftheart radar system a military analyst told the bbc that some of the weapons technology would only be available from the russian military another expert a specialist on the wagner group said the list pointed to the involvement of dmitry utkin he is the exrussian military intelligence man believed to have founded wagner and given it its name his own former callsign the bbc tried to contact dmitry utkin but has received no replyand in our visual

doing its utmost to promote a ceasefire and a political settlement to the crisis in libyathe ministry added that details about wagner in libya are mostly based on rigged data and were aimed at discrediting russias policy in libya officially it does not exist  but up to  people are believed to have taken at least one contract with wagner since it emerged fighting alongside prorussian separatists in eastern ukraine in about  wagner men are estimated to have fought with gen khalifa haftar in libya from  to the bbc in russia asked one of the exfighters to describe wagner he replied it is a structure aimed at promoting the interests of the state beyond our countrys bordersas for its fighters he said they were either professionals of war people looking for a job or romantics looking to serve their countrythe other exfighter told the bbc there were no clear rules of conduct if a captured prisoner had no knowledge to pass on or could not work as a slave then the result is obviousandrey chuprygin an expert working with the russia international council said the stance of the russian government was  let them join this thing and well see what the result is if it works out

united russia is highly unlikely to lose control maintaining a large majority is key both to ensuring its own cohesion and shoring up legitimacy of the putin governmentrussian elections are not entirely free and fair but the actual vote itself has grown more secure over the years this effort to secure the vote results from the governments need for credibility in the form of a popular stamp of approval and in reaction to backlash over past instances and allegations of tampering although voting irregularities still occur at some scale particularly at less centrally controlled regional levels united russia has primarily focused on limiting the ability of opposition groups to compete on a level playing field by making it difficult to get on the ballot limiting access to media and adding layers of bureaucratic restrictionsunited russia has strong political control over the russian federation although over the years the electoral legitimacy its rule is based on has started to wane one problem is its inability to fully deliver on economic promises after a spate of crises following the  recession reduced purchasing power and the dwindling value of the ruble have made the government appear weaker united russia also faces growing pressure due to its authoritarianism and association with corruption or the kleptocracy as the opposition refers to it the russian leadership has become increasingly unpopular and united russia has had electoral setbacks such as losing nearly a third of its seats in the  moscow city council electionsthe partys goals extend beyond simply trying to maintain its majority united russia currently holds just shy of three quarters of duma seats and seeing its share reduced could have significant consequences for starters united russias ability to modify the constitution of the russian federation which it skillfully applied in  well ahead of the upcoming duma elections could be severely hampered if its majority fell below twothirdsperhaps even more important a reduced reserve in duma votes could complicate the cohesion of united russia as a political party or its ability to leverage socalled systemic opposition parties in the state duma as the electoral vehicle of a diverse russian elite united russia is under constant strain from diverging political demands the lower united russias majority in the duma is the greater is the risk of splitting into factions as individual duma delegates seek to exploit thinner margins for their own agendas such factionalism could also provide opportunities for russias systemic opposition parties the communist party for example to carve their own paths lending support as a swing voting bloc currently the systemic opposition acts more as a lobbying group for its members and constituents than a unified opposition perceptions of an electorally weakening united russia in general is also likely to signal these parties to detach themselves from the ruling party to strengthen their own positions in future electionsto counteract the various challenges it faces united russia has taken a carrot and stick approach for the carrot it has sought to show itself as being a responsive government shuffling out or even arresting corrupt local politicians while also sidelining increasingly unpopular figures and promoting those with broader appeal the slow downfall of former russian president dmitry medvedev is part of this the former president and longserving prime minister stepped down as prime minister in  to be replaced by technocrat mikhail mishustin although medvedev remains the chairperson of united russia he has been removed from the partys election listinstead russian defense minister sergei shogyu and russian foreign minister sergey lavrov are at the top of the party list both men are unlikely to take seats in the duma both are very popular as they are seen as standing up for russias interests abroad and as being far less corrupt than medvedev who has long been exposed as having expensive tastes medvedev has been quiescent about his own sidelining remaining supportive of united russia and noting in a recent interview the risk of political instability that comes without a dominant partyunited russia has also attempted to bolster its economic image recent constitutional amendments contained a laundry list of populist economic measures including guarantees for more generous pension and social benefits the government has also sought to show itself as investing in a more prosperous russia with bold development plans and a shift to more effective governance under mishustins managementthe stick in united russias approach is using various means of prosecution and harassment to make it difficult for the new generation of opposition who are from outside the managed opposition parties that have long had a presence in parliament to mount coherent campaigns most prominent among these is the decision to classify the imprisoned dissident alexei navalny and his supporters as members of an extremist organization barring them from standing for the electionother major obstacles also exist to opposition figures mounting a challenge firstly any political party competing on the party list must first be considered legal which can be difficult considering the electoral commission is far from impartial after being approved a party must then receive  percent of the national vote to qualify for a seat in parliament or compete in one of the single member constituencies independents can stand in a single member constituency but to do so they must gather  signatures from registered voters in the area within  days and then have those signatures verified thats a challenging task especially as many voters distrust such petitions or fear their support of an opposition figure could lead to retributionby far the oppositions greatest challenge though is its fragmented nature the only thing that unites the opposition is they are against united russiabeyond that their policies political ideals and views vary widely one reason navalny was targeted was helike previous opposition figures such as andrei sakharov or boris yeltsinwas able to serve as a unifying figure for the disparate opposition groups to rally behindnow that open association with navalny is illegal the opposition remains fragmented but still active and increasingly independents and younger members of established opposition parties are making isolated inroads against united russia it is plausible that at least a few seats will be lost to the opposition in this election the opposition will continue to make inroads in regional and local politics by focusing on bread and butter issues yet the opposition remains deeply divided and unable to offer a coherent alternative vision for russia other than being outside the established power structureultimately united russia remains in a strong electoral position and is likely to dominate political life in the russian federation for some time to come with challenges mounting however the partys focus will increasingly shift to maintaining that position domestically this could represent a break from the past when united russia enjoyed the freedomgranted by its electoral securityto focus on policy rather than politicking the party itself may also have to evolve in terms of how it shapes itself for this new role and how it deals with internal tensions that may arise from itjeff hawn is a doctoral candidate at the london school of economics and political sciences department of

chokepoint is they would probably come up with the suez canal and the panama canal but not a lot of other ones luria said at the hudson institute this monthmany chokepoints are already closely monitored the strait of hormuz through which much of the worlds oil is shipped and the babelmandeb through which suez canal traffic passes both have a heavy multinational military presence to counter threats from state and nonstate actorsother chokepoints are seeing increasing military activity amid changes to the security and natural environmentthe greenlandicelanduk gap which russian warships must transit to reach the atlantic ocean is an area of renewed focus for nato the strait of malacca is a vital channel between the indian and pacific oceans and chinas increasing presence there has worried neighboring countries particularly indiaa more accessible arctic may also make the bering strait busier in march  the us navys top officer said he expected that strait will at some point be strategically as important as the straits of malacca or hormuzus policymakers and military officials have warned repeatedly about chinas presence in those waterways and at ports around the worldchinas construction of bases in the south china sea is an effort to create their own chokepoints in one of the worlds busiest shipping corridors luria said this month adding that chinas sole overseas military base in djibouti near the babelmandeb is also in an incredibly strategic pointbeijing has added a significant pier at that base that can accommodate an aircraft carrier the head of us africa command said this spring warning that china also sought a naval facility on africas atlantic coast where they can rearm and repair warshipschina has also invested heavily in latin american countries which experts say it could leverage for military benefit including around the strait of magellan through which chinese ships first sailed nearly a decade agoadm craig faller head of us southern command has warned about chinese investment in dozens of ports in the region including on both sides of the panama canalarmy gen laura richardson who will replace faller told lawmakers this month that two ports on either end of the panama canal are owned by chinese stateowned enterprises and so thats very concerningin the arctic russia wants to do the same thing that china is doing in the south china sea by exercising control over traffic along the northern sea route luria said this month even before ever given was freed russian officials were using the incident to promote that routeso we literally have the chinese and the russians who want to essentially create new chokepoints and not only that but the chinese have positioned themselves in a variety of ways at every major chokepoint in the world luria addedus officials have warned that chinese investments in infrastructure particularly in ports are being made with the goal of developing dual use capabilities that would support future military operationswhether china has the political influence and logistical ability to establish such facilities is still uncertain but the djibouti base and other facilities that chinese firms own or have stakes in arent suited for power projection according to john culver who retired from the cia in  after more than  years as a chinese military analysti think that the intelligence community can maybe take a breath here about the dire threat of chinese bases as locuses of power projection culver said in may i think theyre really more the accoutrements of a great power especially a country with global tradingbut chinas growing presence around the worlds most important waterways still presents an outsize risk luria said this monththe interruption to the flow of trade and these geographic maritime chokepoints are ways that china can disrupt that are not just oneonone like naval vessel vs naval vessel luria said russia says it discussed plans with japan for joint economic

into the minerva symphony tanker which sails under the greek flagauthorities initially estimated that the spill covered only about  square meters  square feet but russian scientists said wednesday after studying satellite images that it actually covered nearly  square kilometers nearly  square mileswwf russia has estimated that about  metric tons of oil have spilled into the seathe prosecutor

kyrgyzstanit began as a moment of nastiness between a sales assistant and a shopper at a games park in kyrgyzstans capital it has now escalated into an international incidentthe brief episode was captured on august  by a surveillance camera a beefy kyrgyz man glares at the young slavic woman behind the counter suddenly he snatches her calculator and flings it directly at her face later reporting on the attack revealed that the man was incensed that the woman insisted on speaking in russian rather than kyrgyzthe spread of the clip across social media has sparked a heated debate about who was in the right one camp contends the man had no right to behave as he did others chide the woman for her inability – or unwillingness – to speak in kyrgyzprominent politicians in moscow are wading in too claiming to be concerned that russianspeaking citizens may be facing intimidation and aggression in kyrgyzstan – a fact that officials in bishkek deny state duma deputies have alluded to another case in a formal complaint to their kyrgyz counterpartsin late june a nineyearold boy was beaten up at a sports training camp in the issykkul region in what has been described as an assault based on ethnic and religious groundsthe boys parents found bruises and abrasions to his face as well as mild wounds to his lower lip indira sautova a lawyer for the family told eurasianet the coach told them that their child had got into a fight with some boysthe family later withdrew its criminal complaint after receiving apologies from the attackers and their parentsthat did not deter duma speaker vyacheslav volodin from announcing on aug  that the russian legislature was appealing directly for the chairman of the jogorku kenesh as the kyrgyz parliament is known to personally monitor the situationthis is not the first such incident it is unacceptable considering that russian in kyrgyzstan carries official status volodin wrote mps are considering a response which could include a ban on entry into russia for anybody behaving in this way toward russianspeaking residents of kyrgyzstanan even more violent reaction has come from ultranationalist firebrand and kremlin loyalist vladimir zhirinovsky who led a picket on aug  in front of the kyrgyz embassy in moscowrussians have for centuries often at their own detriment developed their periphery built cities and enterprises and brought enlightenment to central asiaeven today hundreds of thousands of kyrgyz families live off earnings in russia hetoldthe crowd our patience is running outwe will demand a reduction in the number of kyrgyz workers in russiathere is alarm among some like kyrgyz mp dastan bekeshev that the whole affair has become excessively politicizedas far as the russian language goes it should retain its official status since we have many russian speakers here as well as many citizens who go to russia for study and work he told eurasianetand rights activist rita karasartova said in an interview to eurasianet that continuing to dwell on this topic only threatens to further sour interethnic ties in kyrgyzstan the whole problem has in any case been framed back to front she arguednonethnic kyrgyz people do not make an effort to learn the state language because they know that russian is an official language and they speak russian fluently and as experience shows these incidents occur specifically because one side is unable to speak kyrgyz she saidedir bova an ethnic dungan activist residing in bishkek told eurasianet that it was only natural that kyrgyz nationals should know the countrys language to some extent especially if they are working in the service sectormany are unable to learn kyrgyz because of a lack of the language around them considering that in bishkek almost everybody can speak russian and then sometimes kyrgyz people come in from the villages they cannot speak russian and when they run into the fact that everybody in the capital does speak russian it cannot but anger them he saidbova did rue however the fact that the state is falling short in its duty to promote kyrgyz curious languagelearners are able for example to find chinese and korean courses free of charge but no such option exists for kyrgyzthats not the only thing discouraging study of the state language the lack of highquality teaching aids for kyrgyz is also hindering its development the government needs to allocate sufficient funds for this he saiddaanakan kurmanbekova  said she and her family found the language barrier made it difficult to adapt when they moved to bishkek from the southern town of batken seven years agoi understand that the russian language can give access to a good education but we must not forget that we are kyrgyz she said it is only in kyrgyzstan that russian operates at an equal level to our native language you dont have that in other central asian nations let alone the caucasus or the balticsthe noise around this scandal has a whiff of artificiality about it though bekeshev suggested that russian politicians may have their thoughts on the sept  duma elections as they play the nationalist cardat the same time another kyrgyz lawmaker irina karamushkina says a conversation is needed around the status of ethnic minorities the seeds of a minorities problem were planted she said with the adoption in  of adocumenttitledconcept for the development of national unity and ethnic relations in the kyrgyz republic in substance the document formalized the idea that kyrgyzstans citizens were organized into a titular ethnicity and ethnic minoritiesuntil that moment we all felt like fullfledged citizens we lived had our troubles and toiled as one people but then slowly under the guise of developing the country kyrgyzstanis of

proton rocket blasted off from baikonur spaceport in kazakhstan a new science lab attached to its topthe long overdue nauka labthats russian for sciencesafely docked with the international space station for a while everything seemed fine aboard the yearold station which currently houses seven crew three americans two russians and one member each from the european and japanese space agenciesgenerally speaking the nasa astronauts command the iss and conduct science experiments the visiting europeans and japanese are usually scientists roscosmos meanwhile sends skilled cosmonauts to maintain the stations hardwarethere are actually two separate neighborhoods in the iss one for the russians another for everyone elsea few hours after docking last week nauka abruptlyand totally on its ownfired its maneuvering rockets the malfunction set the foot station spinning around its axis  miles above earth nasa controllers on the ground in houston were powerless to intervene  only controllers in russia had access to naukas remote controlsbut the radio link required a direct line of sight it was half an hour before the isss orbit took it over russia and roscosmos could turn off the thrusters yeehaw tweeted zebulon scoville the flight director in houston that was a daynasa at first announced that the iss spun just  degrees before the russians regained control five days later nasa admitted it was wrong in fact in its halfhour spin the thinskinned stationwhich is festooned with modules solar panels and heatventing radiatorsrotated  degrees in essence turning around one and a half timesto restore the station to its normal position nasa turned on thrusters for another halfturn station is in good shape and operating normally nasa tweeted the space agency did not immediately respond to a request for commentnasa told spacecom the iss crew was never in danger but scoville tweeted that hed never been so happy to see all solar arrays and radiators still attachedmaybe the iss was in no danger of disintegrating but nasa and roscosmos are lucky the station didnt suffer extensiveand expensivedamage to vital systems roscosmos did not respond to a request for commentworse the july mishap is just the most recent screwup for roscosmos most famously back in august  a russian soyuz capsulewhich helps shuttle people and supplies to the stationsomehow escaped the attention of roscosmos qualitycontrols and arrived at the iss with a millimeterdiameter hole in itonce the soyuz docked with the iss it began sharing the isss breathable atmosphere  and started slowly venting that atmosphere into spacecontrollers in houston and moscow eventually noticed the drop in air pressure and sent the station crew on a hunt for the source the crew patched the capsule and sent it back down to earthinspections turned up chilling details there were several attempts at drilling dmitry rogozin the controversial head of roscosmos space agency said in televised comments what is this a production defect or some premeditated actionsa separate soyuz was involved in another close call two months later a sensor malfunctioned on the rocket boosting two iss crewan american and a russiantoward the station the rocket failed the capsule containing the passengers ejected at an altitude of  miles and parachuted safely back down to kazakhstana year later roscosmos had completed its investigation of the hole on the first soyuz but the russians refused to say publicly what they found out we know exactly what happened but we will not tell you anything rogozin reportedly said at a science conference for kids in september in the meantime nasa and roscosmos detected another slow air leak aboard the iss efforts by the crew in late  narrowed the location of the leak down to you guessed it one of two russianmade modulesif youre sensing a trend youre not wrongwhen properly assembled and operated the soyuz is perhaps the safest spacecraft ever but its not hard to conclude that roscosmos cant be trusted to build and run the coneshaped craftas for newer russian space hardware such as nauka  its as often as not badly designed badly built and badly run the pattern of poor quality control in new hardware in the russian space program has been around for many years john logsdon a professor emeritus at george washington universitys space policy institute told the daily beastto be clear space travel is hard and risky nasa knows this all too well the space shuttle which nasa decommissioned back in  was actually the most dangerous spacecraft ever the bulky fragile spaceplanes two fatal crashes in  and  accounted for  of the  fatalities that have occurred during space missions since the worlds space agencies are eager to avoid adding to this grim figure which helps to explain why relations between nasa and roscosmos have gotten chillierthe russians used to enjoy a reputation for building oldfashioned but rugged and safe space tech today that tech is no less oldfashionedthe soyuz capsule has been in use since but a lot of its also looking less and less safepavel luzin an independent expert on the russian military and space program has a theory there is a huge problem with human capital he told the daily beast most people who worked during the soviet and early postsoviet times and knew how the soviet technologies really workedwith all their pitfallsare retiredthe new generations of engineers and workers suffer from the personnel turnover he added young professionals prefer not to stay too long within the russian space industry because of overregulation and lack of salaries even if they work according to all the instructions they just dont know the pitfallsa lack of money is the toxic thread weaving through roscosmoss problems for a decade between the space shuttles retirement and the introduction of new american capsules roscosmos earned billions of dollars renting rides to the iss on its soyuz capsulesthe importance of those rentals belied the russian space programs funding problems since the fall of the soviet union the russian space program has been chronically underfunded chris impey a university of arizona astronomer told the daily beastits also possible roscosmos and specifically rogozin is a bit  distracted by movies of all thingsin a surprise move in may  nasa announced a plan to send actor tom cruise and director doug liman to the iss to shoot a movie we need popular media to inspire a new generation of engineers and scientists tweeted jim bridenstine the nasa administrator at the timebut the russians are determined to get there first with their own movie shortly after bridenstines announcement rogozin threw together his own plan to send actress yulia peresild and director klim shepenko to the iss to shoot a thriller that rogozin would coproducethat production is scheduled to kick off in october right before cruise and liman arrive rogozins fixation on making a movie in space and doing it first was reportedly the final straw for sergei krikalyov a famous former cosmonaut who was working under rogozin at roscosmos but objected to his boss filmmaking ambitionsso rogozin demoted him according to the newspaper novaya gazeta if rogozin is worried about the safety and reliability of his spacecraft hes certainly not showing it but if the reporting is accurate hes not shy about punishing dissentnasa needs roscosmos on the iss the russians effectively own half of the station and still provide vital services to the other half but the iss wont last forever the biden administration wants to extend the aging station out to  before turning it over to private operatorsafter that nasa plans to shift its attention to a new station the lunar gateway which would fly around the moon in a wide orbit that would allow it to both support a new generation of lunar explorers and function as a staging base for a possible future mission to marsnasa is enlisting the usual foreign space agencies to help out with lunar gatewaywith one big possible exception its looking likelier that roscosmos wont be aboardits not that nasa wouldnt love to keep working with the russians all things being equal its one of the rare areas where washington and moscow arent rivals we are partners in space and i dont want that to cease nasa administrator bill nelson said following a june meeting with rogozinbut the sad state of affairs at the russian agency and rogozins refusal to admit there are problems and fix them might force nelsons hand going forward the stresses in the partnership suggest that it will not last in coming years logsdon saidand even if the russians do join the moon station they wont occupy half of it like they do on the iss if russian hardware isnt reliable or even safe that probably reduces their leverage burbach saidits not just that usrussian relations are fraying as russia descends deeper into authoritarianism invades its neighbors and

denied taking ethiopias side in its dispute with egypt over a massive dam built by addis ababa on the blue nile a main tributary of the nile riverwhile ethiopia an upstream nation says the grand ethiopian renaissance dam gerd is key to its economic development egypt fears the giant dam will imperil its water share from the nile river the countrys main source of fresh water egypt and sudan two downstream countries have been seeking to reach a legally binding agreement with ethiopia on the filling and operation of the gerd a demand rejected by addis ababaas african unionsponsored negotiations failed to produce any breakthrough egypt and sudan requested a un security council session on july  in an attempt to settle the decadelong dispute with ethiopiaduring the session russias delegate to the united nations vasily nebenzya cautioned that the statements of a possible use of force to protect egypts water rights should be avoided the speech however was seen in cairo as russian support to the ethiopian position in the gerd disputebut russian ambassador to egypt georgy borisenko denied that his countrysupportsethiopia in the gerd dispute blaming the perception that moscow was siding with addis ababa on the misinterpretation of the russian speechhe said in an interview withten tv that russia like other member states of the un security council thinks that the council was not the best venue for discussing water disputes our position is balanced as both egypt and ethiopia are partners to russia he saidborisenko explained that moscow understands that the nile river is a truly existential issue for egypt sayingwe understand the concerns of the egyptian friends about the construction of the renaissance damthe russian diplomat said his country is ready to work with ethiopia to reach a negotiated agreement on the gerd we are ready to assist in this effort including working with addis ababa to reach a mutually acceptable agreement at the negotiating tablea few days after the un security council session on july  russia signed a military cooperation agreement with ethiopiaraisingeyebrows in cairothe russian envoy described the signing of the military agreement with ethiopia days after the session as a mere coincidencethe military cooperation deal is a framework agreement it is one of routine agreements that russia has signed and will sign with many of the worlds countries he saidon july  the russian foreign ministry denied any link between the military agreement with ethiopia and the gerd dispute with egypt saying the deal doesnt have any destabilizing character and is similar to joint cooperation agreements signed with other countries including egypt and sudanrakha hassan a former assistant foreign minister and member of the egyptian council for foreign affairs said russia is maintaining a neutral position regarding the gerd dispute russia has major interests in ethiopia and does not want to lose any influence there hassan told almonitor by phonehe said russia like china is of the view that the un security council should not be involved in riverissuesas both have water disputes with their own neighborsthese countries believe that as long as the african union is dealing with the gerd issue there is no need for the un security council to get involved in the dispute hassan addedthe former diplomat said egypt should continue to mobilize major countries such as the united states italy china and russia to pile pressure on ethiopia to help reach an agreement on the gerd he said the gerd is a national security issue for egypt if the dispute is not solved peacefully the situation will spiral out of control something which egypt does not seeka research paper by the center for arabeurasian studies attributed russias support for ethiopia to moscows efforts to expand its influence on the african continent taking advantage of the us estrangement with addis ababa over the tigray conflictrussia is still groping its way in the african continentand does not have the influence to impose its own vision to resolve any conflict especially in a complex and protracted issue such as the gerd the paper read whether moscow supported the position of cairo or addis ababa this will not change anything but russia adheres to what appears to be a neutral position that carries with it support for the ethiopian vision and with it moscow can achieve several gains for its national interestssamuel ramani a tutor of international relations at the university of oxford said russia considered a mediation role in the gerd dispute in  hetold almonitorrussia however realized that ethiopia is averse to any form of external mediation and that any attempt to arbitrate will just antagonize ethiopia and produce no constructive resultsegypt interprets russias reluctance to back its position in the un security council as moscow being proethiopian but in reality russia is trying to balance between cairo and addis ababaramani believes that the progress on the russian nuclear plant in egypt the resumption of russian flights to egyptian resorts and reports about russian plans to expand its trading access to the suez canal suggest that egyptian officials are compartmentalizing their disagreements with russia on the gerd even if they are frustrated with moscows stanceback in  russia viewed mediation as the best way to balance closer ties with egypt and ethiopia now it realizes that mediation will actually undermine its balancing strategy so russia is pursuing a course of nonintervention in the gerd dispute which is not unlike

your requestin august  russian officials hailed the launch of the sputnik v covid vaccine as a major victory for russian science innovation and diplomacy they claimed russia had trumped the west by bringing an effective twoshot vaccine to the global market faster and that the breakthrough would reverberate worldwide twelve months later sputnik v has failed to live up to the hype and its developers at the staterun gamaleya institute in moscow and the russian direct investment fund rdif the countrys sovereign wealth fund are growing uncomfortable under global scrutinydata published in the uk medical journal the lancet indicate that the sputnik v vaccine is safe boosts survival rates of people infected and slows transmission of the deadly disease however lingering questions about data discrepancies and the lack of transparency caused an international group of scientists to question the findings in an open letter to the journal part of the problem is that the gamaleya institute rushed through clinical trials to get it on the market before all others raising questions about the vaccines safety and slowing important regulatory approvals from the eu and the whothe rdif also misplayed global marketing of the vaccine distribution in russia and neighboring countries as well as exporting of the vaccine have been hampered by production problems and a failure to manage global supply chains international sales and distribution are increasingly overshadowed by reports of inflated prices and corruption allegations customers in various countries now want their money back for overpriced or undelivered supplies worse covid is ravaging the russian people in yet another deadly wave this summer due in large part to russian citizens own vaccine hesitancy and questions about sputnik vs efficacyissues that moscows rush to be first in the world helped to createdespite all the russian governments propaganda about sputnik v average russians do not trust it a problem that is now reverberating across the former soviet union low trust in government actions and fatalistic attitudes are hardly new phenomena in russia however russian government efforts to downplay the virus during the first wave of the pandemic in  and to play up the mistakes of western countries led many russians to become skeptical of the need for enhanced public health measures to reduce the viruss spread russian disparagement of other vaccines since then has enhanced overall skepticism toward vaccination in general with russians often expressing hesitancy to receive any shot not just sputnik vwhile vaccine distribution centers across russia initially had a glut of vaccines for months the latest wave of covid has led some russians to reconsider that reluctance to get vaccinated increasingly leading to sputnik v supply shortages at home furthermore the less effective and lesserknown russianproduced epivac vaccine is sometimes the only option for residents of smaller cities and remote areas as a result russias vaccination rate is just  percent one of the lowest in europe and behind many countries including azerbaijan cuba el salvador and moroccoto redress the problem russia rolled out new requirements for certain groups of workers and within specific regions that mandate or incentivize vaccination including providing vaccinated russians easier access to restaurants and recreational activities if they uploaded proof of vaccination to a central database they received a specialized qr code to show at arrivalhowever instead of increasing vaccination rates this qr code policy led to new corruption schemes as russians sought ways around the system including via purchasing doctored vaccine records on the black market technology hiccups related to the qr code also reduced the programs efficacy all these problems caused the city of moscow to scrub the program in late july despite these problems at home rdif headed by kirill dmitriev has been marketing sputnik v globally on behalf of the russian state dmitriev a kremlin insider with a bachelors degree in economics from stanford and a masters degree in business administration from harvard is fluent in english and serves as a public champion of sputnik v internationally in fact he has been deployed by russian president putin in the past to conduct sensitive operations for the kremlin including late  through early  when dmitriev was involved in backchannel diplomacy arranged by the emiratis to the then incoming administration of former us president donald trump recently dmitriev has sought to improve the vaccines and russian sciences public image through numerous interviews and has helped to broker highprofile deals with influential countries to buy the vaccineagain often through back channels and through his existing connections to the uaeargentina ghana hungary india mexico nigeria peru the philippines and the uae are among almost seventy countries that have all authorized sputnik vs use and distribution they and other states have struck deals with the rdif to buy millions of doses and in some cases even made agreements to produce it domestically such deals made sense in late  and early  when there were limited other options russias sputnik v was particularly attractive when europe and the united states struggled with vaccination rollouts amid accusations the west was hoarding vaccines while leaving others unprotected for years to come the deals also likely boosted dmitrievs personal reputation within the kremlin and this bid for improved patronage in russian elite circles was as much a motivator for him as the lucrative financial benefits to the rdif and vaccine middlemenyet russias covid vaccine diplomacy has fallen far short of its original goals and has disappointed global public health officials eager for alternatives to the mrna vaccines that are difficult to produce and store although russian officials initially suggested the sputnik v vaccine would be a key part of the global solution to the pandemic moscow has made only minimal contributions to the covax program a who initiative to supply vaccines to poorer countries and emerging economies the eu united states and other developed economies are major contributors to covax although the program has been badly hobbled by rich countries stockpiling of vaccines for their own populations however moscow essentially opted not to participate in covax either through financial contribution or inkind doses of sputnik v instead the rdif has focused on commercially based bilateral deals in various parts of the world however the rdif is also having trouble fulfilling its commercial contracts for the vaccine as of may  russia reportedly had produced only  million doses out of  million it had promised dmitriev and the fund instead appear to be part of a smoke and mirrors exercise with few exceptions russia has failed to deliver on many of its signed agreements leaving some recipient countries particularly in africa with only enough doses to vaccinate a few thousand elites while the fund continues to push snappy public relations materials and social media campaigns lauding sputnik vs global success international supply problems have left countries that rely on sputnik v without enough doses to vaccinate their populations including the elderly and other vulnerable groupsargentina is witnessing a public uproar because several million people have been waiting for over three months for their second sputnik v dose due to supply problems the rdifs failure to deliver forced the argentine government to raise the issue with moscow in a scathing letter critical of russian missteps that was leaked to the argentine press buenos airess decision to rely largely on sputnik v has created political uncertainty for the centerleft argentine president alberto fernández who suffered a covid breakthrough case of his own two months after being inoculated with sputnik v since assuming office in  fernández broke with his predecessor mauricio macris skepticism toward moscow and pivoted toward a more russianfriendly stance reminiscent of former president cristina fernández de kirchner who incidentally is back in government as argentinas vice president the current fernández government is accused of making a geopolitical choice in its decision to spurn vaccines of european or american origin and to rely on sputnik v instead although current supply problems have caused buenos aires to start seeking alternatives in recent weeks similar delays with sputnik v deliveries have been documented in bolivia guatemala mexico and the philippines complicating those countries ability to fully immunize atrisk populationsunfortunately there is a growing body of evidence indicating that the rdifs marketing arrangements have involved overpricing and potential corruption schemes in november  the fund officially announced that sputnik v would be sold for less than  a dose cheaper than the pfizer vaccine but still more expensive than the astrazenecaoxford university shot which is sold at cost however it appears that in many cases sputnik v is being sold for much more than the initially announced price furthermore dmitrievs ties to the uae appear to be coming back to haunt him in a new context investigative reporting in russia has uncovered a convoluted scheme in which the rdif gave a uae firm exclusive sputnik v resale rights at inflated prices to at least five countries in africa asia and the middle eastthe government of ghana for example recently cancelled a commercial contract to purchase sputnik v through a uae broker at  per dose roughly double the normal price amid a parliamentary inquiry over corruption in vaccine procurement and nondelivery of the required doses similarly kenya blocked the use of sputnik v after the countrys first  doses were revealed to have been delivered through the same uae middleman at twice the suggested price as opposed to directly from the rdif as nairobi had expected kenyan health authorities initially were concerned the doses the country had received were counterfeit particularly after russian embassy officials in the country confirmed there was no deal between the kenyan and russian governments on importing sputnik v yet they were legitimate sputnik v doses imported and procured by a private kenyan pharmaceutical company and offered to consumers at some local clinics for up to  per shotdespite the eus stated willingness to consider sputnik v for emergency use the vaccines russian developers have repeatedly missed deadlines to pass key data on its use to the european medicines agencythe eu regulatory body that decides on emergency use authorization for the entire bloc scientists and regulators in other countries including the rdifs priority marketing targets like brazil and south africa have raised questions about vaccine efficacy and the timely provision of data although brazil and south africa are partners of russia in the brics consortium brazils regulator flagged concerns about the vaccines safety before only allowing some states to import the vaccine under highly constrained conditions south africa has a rolling emergency authorization approval process and has yet to officially approve the vaccine there initially were concerns in spring  about its efficacy against the south african variant of the disease and the continued delay in approval now appears tied to insufficient data being supplied from the russian siderussian officials respond to questions about sputnik v with fury when international regulators or scientists question the vaccines efficacy and refuse to authorize its use russian developers do not rush in with additional data they instead complain about market access and unfair competition from western pharmaceutical companies in key markets russian officials also play to antiwestern sentiment even claiming frances hesitancy to approve sputnik v is akin to racism imperial hegemony and neonazism a message that likely is intended to sully pariss image on the african continent where the two countries have been locked in a media disinformation campaign russianfriendly media in africa appear to be trying to amplify that messagesputnik vs problems however are illustrative of russias domestic and international challenges the russian population is skeptical of its own government and quick to find ways around government measures which has exacerbated the public health crisis and prolonged russias economic distress internationally russias growing aspirations for great power status have been far more symbolic than substantial and its attempt to bolster its reputation in the global south africa latin america asia through marketing sputnik v is running into realityrestricted by significant resource problems and hemmed in by its own narrative of sputnik vs promise russia has had only limited successes in working toward its goals further by overpromising and underdelivering russia is losing a real opportunity to provide vaccines to those countries in dire need of them especially amid rising global concern about wealthy western countries stockpiling doses moscows decision to effectively abstain from the covax program has done little to address the global public health emergencythe distribution of sputnik v is increasingly looking like an opportunity for personal enrichment and patronage for kremlin insiders and middlemen instead of bolstering russias image and its reputation for innovation corrupt deals like those offered to kenya or ghana and the failure to deliver on its contract requirements in argentina tarnish the image of russian science and industry sputnik v is proving to be another example of russias ambitions exceeding its capabilitiesthe authors would like to thank open society foundations for supporting their research correction this piece has been

clearest advantages its global network of alliances but even as biden builds a coalition to tame beijing he also needs to work the other side of the equation by weakening chinas own international partnerships he cant stop chinas rise but he can limit its influence by trying to lure away from china its main collaborator russiathe chineserussian partnership significantly augments the challenge that chinas rise poses to the united states teamwork between beijing and moscow amplifies chinas ambition and reach in many regions of the world in the battle for control of global institutions and in the worldwide contest between democracy and illiberal alternatives piggybacking on chinas growing power allows russia to punch above its weight on the global stage and energizes moscows campaign to subvert democratic governance in europe and the united statesthe bond between china and russia appears to be strongbut there are cracks beneath the surface it is an asymmetrical relationship one that pairs an ascendant confident and selfregarding china with a stagnant and insecure russia that asymmetry gives biden an opening to put distance between the two countries his administration should

itselfbiden can encourage moscow to drift away from beijing splitting russia from china would check both countries ambitions making it easier for the united states and its democratic partners to defend their liberal values and institutions and to shape a peaceful international system in an increasingly multipolar and ideologically diverse worldchina and russia may be in a marriage of convenience but it is a very effective one china generally goes it alone on the international stage preferring transactional and armslength relationships with other countries yet it makes an exception for russia today beijing and moscow have forged a relationship that is alliancelike to use russian president vladimir putins term it encompasses deepening economic ties including efforts to reduce the us dollars dominance in the global economy the joint use of digital technology to control and surveil chinese and russian citizens and sow dissent inside the worlds democracies and cooperation on defense such as joint military exercises and the transfer of advanced weapons systems and technology from russia to chinarussias tilt toward china has accompanied its estrangement from the west which deepened with the extension of natos eastern frontier to russias western border moscows outreach to beijing intensified after the european union and the united states imposed sanctions on russia following its  annexation of crimea and military intervention in eastern ukraine beijing has reciprocated leaning toward moscow to magnify chinas influence amid mounting economic and strategic rivalry with the united states since xi jinping became chinas president in  he and putin have met or spoken on the phone around  timesthe chineserussian relationship is grounded in a realistview of the world and both countries reap mutual and individual benefits from it diplomatic teamwork advances their unifying goal of resisting what they see as the wests encroaching geopolitical and ideological ambition the partnership allows russia to focus its strategic attention on its western frontier and china to focus on its maritime flank russia gets substantial revenue from energy and arms sales to china and china fuels the expansion of its economy and boosts its military capability with the help of russian weaponrybut the two countries are not natural partners historically they have been competitors and the sources of their longrunning rivalry are hardly gone for good the kremlin is acutely sensitive to power realities and it knows full well that a sluggish russia of some  million people is no match for a dynamic china of nearly one and a half billion people chinas economy is roughly ten times as large as that of russia and china is in an entirely different league when it comes to innovation and technology chinas belt and road initiative bri has made deep inroads into russias traditional sphere of influence in central asia and the kremlin is justifiably worried that china also has designs on the arctic regionthat russia still cleaves to china despite such asymmetries is a potent sign of moscows disaffection from the west yet the imbalance will only grow over time and will become an everlarger source of discomfort for the kremlin washington needs to capitalize on that discomfort and convince russia that it would be better off geopolitically and economically if it hedged against china and tilted toward the westsuch a gambit will not be easy to pull off putin has long strengthened his grip at home by playing to russian nationalism and standing up to the west he and his apparatchiks might prove too set in their ways and unwilling to countenance a foreign policy that is not predicated on such posturing accordingly the biden administration has to approach moscow with eyes wide open as it tries to lure russia westward it cannot acquiesce to the kremlins aggressive behavior or allow putin to exploit washingtons extended handbidens challenge will be more complicated than that faced by us president richard nixon in the s when he reached out to china and succeeded in roiling chinesesoviet relations and weakening the communist bloc by the time of nixons visit to china in  beijing and moscow had already parted ways nixon had it easy his task was to build on not initiate a rift biden faces the higher hurdle of prying apart an intact partnershipwhich is why his best bet is to stoke latent tensions in the chineserussian relationshipchina and russia have long competed over territory and status the land border between the two countries currently runs more than  miles and their disputes over territory influence in the border regions and trade go back centuries during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries china held the upper hand and generally prevailed the tables turned in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries with russia and other european powers resorting to a mix of military predation and coercive diplomacy to wrest control of territory from china and impose exploitative terms of tradethe coming to power of the chinese communist party ccp in  cleared the way for a historically unprecedented period of strategic cooperation between china and the soviet union building on their shared commitment to communism the two countries concluded a formal alliance in  thousands of soviet scientists and engineers moved to china sharing industrial and military technology and even helping the chinese develop a nuclear weapons program during the korean war the soviets provided china with supplies military advisers and air cover bilateral trade mounted quickly representing  percent of chinas foreign commerce by the end of the decade chinese leader mao zedong asserted that the two countries had a close and brotherly relationship soviet premier nikita khrushchev called chinas communist revolution the most outstanding event in world historybut the alliance soon eroded as quickly as it had come together mao and khrushchev began to part ways in  their fallingout stemmed in part from ideological differences mao sought to mobilize the peasantry stoking revolutionary fervor and social upheaval at home and abroad khrushchev in contrast supported ideological moderation industrialized socialism and political stability at home and abroad the two countries began to compete for leadership of the communist bloc with mao remarking that khrushchev is afraid that the communist parties    of the world will not believe in them but ussuch differences were magnified by chinas discomfort with power asymmetries that decidedly favored the soviet union in a  speech mao accused the soviet union of bigpower chauvinism the following year he complained to the soviet ambassador in beijing that you think you are in a position to control us in maos estimation the russians considered china a backward nation khrushchev for his part blamed mao for the split after chinese and indian troops exchanged fire across their contested border in  khrushchev commented that beijing was craving for war like a cock for a fight at at a gathering of party heads from the communist bloc he derided mao as an ultraleftist an ultradogmatistthis rupture between the two leaders resulted in the unraveling of chinesesoviet collaboration in  the soviets withdrew their military experts from china and broke off strategic cooperation in the two years that followed bilateral trade plummeted by some  percent the border was remilitarized and fighting that erupted in  almost triggered a fullscale war in the early s nixon capitalized on and exacerbated the rift by reaching out to china a process that culminated in the normalization of uschinese relations in  it would not be until after the collapse of the soviet union that relations between moscow and beijing would recoverfollowing the end of the cold war china and russia began to patch things up over the course of the s the two countries resolved a number of remaining border disputes and in  they signed the treaty of goodneighborliness and friendly cooperation they gradually deepened military cooperation and trade ties with the first oil pipeline from russia to china completed in  beijing and moscow also began to align their positions at the united nations and collaborated on initiatives meant to counter western influence such as establishing the shanghai cooperation organization in  and the socalled brics brazil russia india china south africa economic grouping in these incremental steps toward bilateral cooperation deepened and quickened under xi and putin fueled by moscows breach with the west following russias invasion of ukraine and the growing rivalry between the united states and china in recent years the relationship between china and russia has begun to resemble the close chinesesoviet coupling of the s building on the military cooperation that began in the s russia has been helping china address its top defense priorities by providing jet fighters stateoftheart air defense systems antiship missiles and submarines some  percent of chinas arms imports have come from russia in recent years the sale of oil and gas to china buoys russias economy and reduces chinas dependence on more vulnerable maritime supply routes russia now rivals saudi arabia as chinas top oil supplier and china has replaced germany as russias top trading partner under xi and putin china and russia have teamed up to counter liberal norms in international bodies and propagate a brand of governance based on autocratic rule and state control of information platforms in many parts of the world russian disinformation campaigns and intelligence operations are combining with the coercive leverage afforded by chinese investment to support illiberal regimesthis cooperation across multiple dimensions is impressive and consequential but it rests on a fragile base and lacks a foundation of mutual trustas did the chinesesoviet partnership of the early cold war in the s close ties between china and the soviet union were highly personalized making them vulnerable to the vagaries of the relationship between mao and khrushchev today chineserussian cooperation depends heavily on the unpredictable relationship between two individuals xi and putin during the cold wars first decade moscow sought stability at home and abroad while beijing favored continuous revolution today beijing banks on domestic and international stability to speed its rise whereas moscow flexes its muscles beyond its borders to foster disorder during the s moscows dominance of the partnership bred resentment in beijing today china enjoys the upper hand and stark power asymmetries rankle russiathe power gap is particularly hard for the kremlin to swallow looking like xis sidekick does not play well at home for putin whose political brand rests on his bid to restore russia to greatpower status but the disparity between the two countries is glaring and growing trade with china accounts for more than  percent of all of russias foreign trade whereas trade with russia represents around one percent of chinas foreign commerce and this imbalance is mounting as chinas hightech sector advances in russias far east some six million russians live across the border from roughly  million chinese in the three provinces of manchuria and the region is becoming increasingly dependent on chinese goods services and labor dmitri trenin a prominent russian analyst has gone so far as to speculate about a potential chinese takeover of the regionit has been a long time since the two countries have openly quarreled over territory and influence in the border regions but nationalism and ethnocentrism run deep in both political cultures and could reignite longstanding territorial disputes the south china morning post recently ran a commentary arguing that xis courtship of moscow makes no sense because it ignores the animosity that has defined sinorussian relations since the    th century and antichinese sentiment in russia continues to get tractionstoked as elsewhere by covids chinese origins but such biases long predate the pandemic sustained in part by the same racial prejudices that mao complained about six decades agorussias growing economic dependence on china leaves it increasingly exposed to beijings coercive leverage and deepens russias addiction to exporting fossil fuels the sale of which represents over twothirds of russias export income and onethird of the federal budget this hardly represents a good bet on the future as the world turns toward renewable sources of energy chinas bri is spreading investment and infrastructure across eurasia but the initiative mostly circumvents russia providing it few benefits only a handful of new border crossings have opened in recent years and chinese investment in russia has been paltrythe russians envisage linking their own eurasian economic union to the bri but the two systems compete with more than complement each other in  the eaeu proposed  transportation projects to chinaand beijing rejected all of them russias foreign minister was a noshow at a highlevel meeting on the bri last year indicating according to ankur shah an analyst who focuses on chineserussian relations that moscow no longer feels obliged to bow before beijings belt and road china has effectively replaced russia as the dominant economic power in central asia and beijings interest in tapping into economic development and new shipping lanes in the high northwhat china calls the arctic silk roadposes a clear challenge to russias strategy in the region chinas plans for the arctic ostensibly complement russian ones but as with the eaeu and the bri the competing visions stoke unease in moscowmeanwhile the defense relationship between china and russia has lost some of its earlier momentum the chinese military has benefited from transfers of russian arms and weapons technology and moscow has welcomed the resulting revenue and military cooperation yet advances in chinas own defense industrymade possible in part by chinese companies theft of russian weapons technologyare making china less reliant on russian imports chinas acquisition of intermediaterange missiles ostensibly intended to counter the united states forward presence also poses a hypothetical threat to russian territory and moscow is no doubt closely monitoring chinas expanding arsenal of intercontinental missiles and the construction of new launch silos in western china russia has aided and abetted chinas military modernizationperhaps at its own expenseif russia is to be drawn westward it will result not from washingtons overtures or altruism but from the kremlins cold reassessment of how best to pursue its longterm selfinterest an offer from washington to reduce tensions with the west will not succeed on its own after all putin relies on such tensions to legitimate his iron political grip instead the challenge facing washington is to change the kremlins broader strategic calculus by demonstrating that more cooperation with the west can help russia redress the mounting vulnerabilities arising from its close partnership with chinawashingtons first step should be to drop its democracy versus autocracy framing of us strategy the united states and its ideological partners of course need to ensure that they can deliver for their citizens and outperform illiberal alternatives but casting the contest in overtly ideological terms serves only to push russia and china closer together instead the biden administration should have a candid discussion with moscow about areas in which the longterm national interests of the united states and those of russia overlap including when it comes to china to be sure russia and the united states remain at odds on many fronts but rather than settling for continued estrangement washington should try to find common ground with moscow on a wide range of issues including strategic stability cybersecurity and climate change this dialogue even in the absence of rapid progress would signal to moscow that it has options other than alignment with chinathe biden administration should press its democratic allies to have similar conversations with russia they too can probe areas of mutual interest and highlight how chinas growing strength comes at the expense of russias influence and security given indias longstanding ties to russia and its skeptical view of chinese intentions new delhi may be particularly adept at driving home to moscow the merits of maintaining strategic autonomy and the potential perils of having too close a relationship with beijing to encourage india to help pull russia away from china washington should waive sanctions that are currently pending against india for its purchase of russias s air defense systemthe united states and its allies should also help reduce russias growing economic dependence on china although china is now russias biggest single trading partner russias trade with the eu is far larger than its trade with china representing almost  percent of russias foreign commerce bidens decision to effectively greenlight the controversial nord stream  gas pipeline which will carry russian gas to germany was a wise investment in encouraging deeper trade links between russia and europe and although western sanctions against russia were a necessary response to moscows aggressive behavior they have had the effect of pushing russia further into chinas economic embrace accordingly the united states and its partners should think twice before introducing new sanctions and should lay out a clear set of steps that russia can take to persuade washington to scale back existing ones including committing to a diplomatic resolution to the conflict in eastern ukraine and reining in russiabased cyberattacks on us networksthe united states and its partners should also indicate that they are prepared to help russia combat climate change and transition its economy away from its dependence on fossil fuels in the near term that task entails sharing best practices for capturing methane assisting with the development of green alternatives to the production of oil and gas and taking other steps to limit russian emission of greenhouse gases in the longer term the united states should help russia transition to a knowledge economya step that putin has never taken to the clear detriment of his country china rarely shares technology it is a taker not a giver the united states should seize the opportunity to share technological knowhow with russia to facilitate its transition to a greener more diversified economythe united states should build on the conversation about strategic stability that biden and putin launched at their meeting in geneva in june russias violation of the intermediaterange nuclear forces treaty prompted the united states to withdraw from it in  the united states and russia now need to find a solution to their own looming missile race and also push china to accept a followon agreement that would put limits on chinas large and diverse arsenal of intermediaterange missiles even if a tripartite pact proved unreachable trying to negotiate one would likely illuminate fissures between moscow and beijing given chinas traditional reluctance to enter into arms control agreements russia also has a vested interest in pulling china into a broader conversation with the united states about nonproliferationone that addresses nuclear programs in iran and north korea where us and russian interests overlapthe arctic is another area where washington can help moscow see the strategic downsides of abetting beijings growing ambitions climate change is dramatically increasing the accessibility of the high north prompting new russian interest in the regions economic and strategic importance and stirring russian discomfort with chinas declaration that it is a neararctic power washington and moscow hardly see eyetoeye on the region but through both the arctic council and bilateral dialogue they should develop a more robust set of rules of the road governing economic and military activity in the arctic and addressing their mutual concerns about chinese designsfinally washington should encourage moscow to help check chinas growing influence in developing areas including central asia the broader middle east and africa in most regions russian policy regularly runs counter to us interests moscow still sees washington as its main competitor yet as beijing continues to extend its economic and strategic reach moscow will come to see that it is china not the united states that regularly undercuts russian influence in many of these areas washington should make that case helping bring russian and us interests into greater alignment and creating opportunities for coordinating regional strategygiven the antagonism and mistrust that currently plague relations between russia and the united states it will take time and purposeful diplomacy for washington to change moscows strategic calculus russia may well stick with its current courseperhaps until putin eventually leaves office but in light of the impressive pace and scope of chinas geopolitical ascent now is the time to begin sowing the seeds of a chineserussian split especially among the younger cadre of russian officials and thinkers who will take the reins after putin departs the sceneus efforts to manage chinas rise successfully and peacefully will be significantly advanced if china faces strategic pressure on more than its maritime flank and can no longer count on russias steady military and diplomatic support currently china is able to focus on expansion in the western pacific and farther afield in part because it has a relatively free hand along its continental borders and enjoys moscows backing the united states would be wise to invest in a longterm strategy to change that equation by helping put chinas relationship with russia back into play doing so would be an important step toward building a

similar but human rights groups say the russian authorities use the foreign agent designation as a way of stifling dissentsince  the russian government has used the foreign agents law to demonize independent groups that accept foreign funding and carry out public advocacy especially those that in any way challenge government policies and actions human rights watch said in november in russia the term foreign agent has a strong negative connotation akin to traitorwhen the russian law came up in a meeting of the kremlins human rights council in december putin recalled the case of maria butina a russian citizen who spent more than a year in us detention after being charged with acting as an unregistered foreign agent putin told the council that it was necessary for russia to designate individuals as foreign agents because some people are simply inventing new ways of getting money from abroad for their activitiesputin told nbc news in june that many organizations of socalled civil society are financed and receive training from abroad to prevent this kind of interference in our domestic affairs we make relevant decisions and adopt relevant laws he saidfor the russian authorities putins hard line is a green light to crack down on civil societythe way they perceive civil society is he who pays the piper calls the tune says maxim trudolyubov a contributing editor to meduza and a senior adviser to the kennan institute at the woodrow wilson center in washington dc they decided for the public that the reason for anything that goes wrong comes from the west from abroadtrudolyubov says putin needs to manufacture threats to keep his grip on power but the totalitarian instinct behind the kremlins foreign agent law he says clashes with the complex diverse society that russia has becomeputin himself is part of a generation that remembers the soviet union very well and he wants to be in control says trudolyubov he is very nervous to see he cannot achieve

further trouble or embarrassment many victims dont even notify the policea few years ago the ransom may have been a few hundred bucks in early may colonial pipeline shelled out  million to the darkside ransomware gang to get oil flowing through its pipes again some was recovered by the justice department in june the meat processor jbs paid  million to the russianbased revil ransomware evil gang about a month ago revil came back to score what may be the biggest attack yet freezing the systems of about a thousand companies after hacking an it service provider they all used the ask this time was  million the criminals behind ransomware have also evolved expanding from lone sharks to a business in which tasks are farmed out to groups of criminals specializing in hacking collecting ransom or marshaling armies of botsransomware attacks can cripple critical infrastructure like hospitals and schools and even core functions of major cities using methods as simple as spoof emails hackers can take over entire computer systems and pilfer personal data and passwords and then demand a ransom to restore accessin about a dozen years ransomware has emerged as a major cyberproblem of our time big enough for president biden to put it at the top of his agenda with russias president vladimir putin when they met in june and for lawmakers in congress to be working on several bills that would among other things require victims to report attacks to the governmentit is a war that needs to be fought and won while the extortion business is run by a relatively small network of criminals seeking windfall profits their ability to seriously disrupt economies and to breach strategically critical enterprises or agencies also makes them a formidable potential threat to national security the colonial pipeline attack created an almost instant shortage of fuel and spread panic in the southeastern united statesbig strikes make the big news but the main prey of the ransomware gangs is the small to medium enterprise or institution that is devastated by the disruption of its computers and the ransom payment how many have been hit is anybodys guess  unlike breaches of personal information the law does not require most ransomware attacks to be reported though that is another thing congress may soon changethe fbi internet crime report for  listed  attacks in the united states with losses totaling more than  million the reality is probably of a different magnitude the german datacrunching firm statista has estimated that there were  million attacks worldwide in  a  percent increase over  most of them statista said were in the professional sector  lawyers accountants consultants and the likewhatever the true scope the problem will not be solved with patches antivirus software or twofactor authentication though security experts stress that every bit of protection helps were not going to defend ourselves out of this problem said dmitri alperovitch the chairman of silverado policy accelerator and a leading authority on ransomware we have too many vulnerabilities companies that are small libraries fire departments will never afford the required security technology and talentthe battle must be joined elsewhere and the place to start is russia that according to the experts is where the majority of attacks originate three other countries  china iran and north korea  are also serious players and the obvious commonality is that all are autocracies whose security apparatuses doubtlessly know full well who the hackers are and could shut them down in a minute so the presumption is that the criminals are protected either through bribes  which given their apparent profits they can distribute lavishly  or by doing pro bono work for the government or bothits clear that the ransomware gangs take care not to target the powers that shelter them security analysts found that revil code was written so that the malware avoids any computer whose default language is russian ukrainian belarusian tajik armenian azerbaijani georgian kazakh kyrgyz turkmen uzbek tatar romanian or syriacfinding the criminals is not the problem the us government has the wherewithal to identify and arrest wouldbe cyberblackmailers on its own soil and to help allies find them on theirs in fact washington has identified and indicted many russian cybercriminals  the fbi for example has offered a reward of  million for information leading to the arrest of one evgeniy bogachev aka lucky a master hacker in southern russia whose malware has led to financial losses of more than  millionthe key is to compel mr putin to act against them at his summit with him in june mr biden said he demanded that russia take down the ransomware gangs it harbors and identified  critical sectors of the american economy on which attacks would provoke a responseyet two weeks later revil made the biggest strike ever hacking into kaseya a firm that supplies management software for the it industry and attacking hundreds of its smallbusiness customers that led mr biden to telephone mr putin and to say afterward that we expect them to act asked by a reporter whether he would take down revils servers if mr putin did not mr biden simply said yes shortly after that revil abruptly disappeared from the dark webtempting as it might be to believe that mr biden persuaded the russians to act or knocked the bands servers out with american means it is equally possible that revil went dark on its own intending as happens so often in its shadowy world to reappear later in other guisesso long as the hackers focus on commercial blackmail abroad mr putin probably sees no reason to shut them down they do not harm him or his friends and they can be used by his spooks when necessary unlike the official hackers working for military intelligence who have drawn sanctions from washington and europe for meddling in elections or mucking around in government systems mr putin can deny any responsibility for what the criminal gangs do its just nonsense its funny he said in june when asked about russias role in ransomware attacks its absurd to accuse russia of thisthe russians apparently also believe they can parlay their control over the ransomware gangs into negotiating leverage with the west sergei rybakov the deputy foreign minister who leads the russian side in strategic stability talks launched at the bidenputin summit indicated as much when he complained recently that the united states was focusing on ransomware separately from other security issues ransomware he implied was part of a bigger pile of bargaining chipsthat said mr alperovitch suggests that mr putin does not appreciate how seriously the new american president takes ransomware for reasons still unclear donald trump as president was prepared to give mr putin carte blanche for any cybermischief mr biden by contrast sees himself as the champion of small business and the middle class and it is there that ransomware hurts the mostwriting in the washington post mr alperovitch and matthew rojansky an expert on russia who heads the kennan institute at the wilson center argued that mr biden should confront mr putin with a clear message crack down or else if the russians do not the authors wrote the biden administration could hit russia where it hurts by sanctioning its largest gas and oil companies which are responsible for a significant portion of the russian governments revenuedrawing red lines for russia does not usually work the message would best be delivered privately so that mr putin would not be challenged to publicly back down before the united states it is possible that mr biden has already delivered such a message if so he should be prepared to follow throughthe other critical factor in ransomware is cryptocurrency by no coincidence there were few ransomware attacks before bitcoin came into being a dozen years ago now cybercriminals can be paid off in a currency thats hard to track or recover though the us government managed to do just that when it recouped  million of the colonial pipeline stashcryptocurrency is reportedly one of the issues addressed in legislation soon to be introduced by the senate homeland security committee congress is also being urged by federal law enforcement agencies to pass a law compelling companies in critical industry

vowed to help modernize and reequip yerevans armyin a statement azerbaijans defense ministry said russian peacekeeping troops temporarily deployed in azerbaijan should take action against the presence of armenian forces in the country under a trilateral agreement inked last yearthe ministry accused armenian forces of moving into azerbaijani territory and building outposts actions prohibited under the nov   treatythese new posts are being set up near mukhtarkend and shushakend as well as in the territories to the east of the administrative boundaries of the kalbajar and lachin regions it addednoting that azerbaijani military forces had taken the necessary measures to prevent such behavior it said that yerevan seeks to escalate tension between the two countriesit further argued that a recent order by armenias new defense minister arshak karapetyan for the armenian military to use force by any means was irresponsible and provocativemeanwhile russian defense minister sergey shoigu stated on the same day that russia will help reequip and modernize the armenian armed forces praising yerevan as russias ally and a key partner in the caucasus regionshoigu promised further support to the country as he greeted his armenian counterpart karapetyan at a meeting in moscowwe attach great importance to the development of our cooperation in the military field both in the bilateral format and within the framework of the csto collective security treaty organization at the same time we are ready to continue to assist in the implementation of the program for the reform and reequipment of

capabilities of his armed forceshe stressed that his first international visit as defense minister is to russiarussia is the only state that provides really tangible security for the armenian people and today deals with security issues not only in nagornokarabakh but also directly on the borders of armenia we are ready for very close and effective cooperation he saidarmenia had previously

perfectly well what is and what is not acceptableaccording to the lawmaker neither he vahabzadeh nor those in national republics which became young but not independent states at russias good will who insult russia and russians are scared of consequenceswhile there will be consequences or there should be apologies one person can forgive another however insulting people religion and state remain in history between states tolstoy concludedearlier a video address by vahabzadeh emerged online where he delivered brazen insults against russians as an ethnic group and specifically leader of the russian liberal democratic party vladimir zhirinovsky zhirinovsky later said that he would seek a criminal case against the former envoy the azerbaijani foreign ministry informed that the former ambassador is currently not speaking on behalf of any state institutions he was released from his position of ambassador in  for poor performance russias robot fighter apparently isnt very robotic russias robot fighter apparently isnt very roboticrussian defense minister sergei shoigu visits the s production linein the race to develop robotic fighter jets it might look like russia is pulling ahead of the united states but appearances can be deceiving russias first few robot fighters  probably wont be very roboticthe russian and us air forces both are developing fast armed unmanned aerial vehicles that in theory would accompany manned fighters into combat adding their sensors and weapons to a fastmoving battlebut these socalled wingman drones require a high degree of autonomy in order to keep up and while russia quickly is moving to build its s okhotnik wingman drone its not making a lot of obvious progress on the autonomy that could make the type a viable combatantits likely that the first batch of ss will be either directed from the ground or from su aircraft so that the okhotnik will be a remotecontrolled vehicle initially said samuel bendett an analyst with the center for a new american security in washington dc and the center for naval analysis in virginiabendett cowrote a recent study on russian roboticsrussian defense minister sergei shoigu caused a minor stir last week when he dropped by sukhois novosibirsk aviation plant in siberia to inspect the s assembly linethe jetpropelled okhotnik flew for the first time in august  a subsonic flyingwing with some stealth qualities the s is in roughly the performance class as the valkyrie wingman drone the us air force is developing as part of its skyborg initiative the idea is for selfguiding ss eventually to fly alongside manned su stealth fighters but that demands sophisticated artificial intelligence where the us air force as part of its skyborg effort is focusing on developing the ai the russians appear to be focusing on the airframeseveral ss are under construction at the novosibirsk aviation plant some time next year they could join the single okhotnik thats already undergoing flight testing we hope that by  the work will be completed and we will be able to sign  a large longterm contract shoigu said the americans meanwhile dont have firm plans to transition skyborg to a production program the ai isnt ready the russians for their part dont seem to mind pushing ahead without full autonomy the kremlin claims that okhotnik will have ai but offers little detail beyond such statements bendett said presumably the defense ministry is working on different types of algorithms that would allow s to fly navigate and possibly engage targets on its own after the human operator would approve flight patterns and targetselection and recognition bendett addedbut thats all just conjecture the american skyborg already has begun rigorous autonomy trials but the russian wingman drone apparently still relies on a human operator who directly controls it autonomy isnt the ss only problem the drone with its foot wingspan is a big uav and that translates into high cost that in turn limits how fast the kremlin can acquire the type a single s could cost up to  million according to bendett compare that the american valkyrie with its foot wingspan it costs just  million the us air force all along has said that wingman drones should be attritable  that is expendable in combat okhotnik does not appear to be economically attritable this is an expensive aircraft and it would take a while for the russian mod to scale up its production and to get to the point where this drone can truly fly on its own in future combat bendett saidim a journalist author and filmmaker based in columbia south

events that russian female athletes have historically dominated with crushing mastery including artistic swimming and rhythmic gymnastics lie aheadrussians have pointed with pride to the actions of a female fencer marta martyanova whatever the name of her teamms martyanova refused to bow out despite a leg trauma painful enough to leave her crying and hopping on one foot at that point no substitutes were allowed in the team competition and withdrawal would have cost the russians a shot at a medal so her stoic endurance saved the day russias team went on to win the golda true young

commentator for telesport said in an interviewthey just want to watch sports not think about what is happening in medical laboratories he saidthe roots of the restrictions lie in one of the worst cheating scandals in sports history during the  winter olympics in sochi there was a campaign by coaches athletes and the russian security services to swap contaminated urine samples for clean onesthe violations eventually came to involve more than  athletes coaches and sports officials in russia and led to blanket bans on russias competing in international sports including the olympicsrussia spent years trying to overturn the bans and in december won a partial victory in the court of arbitration for sport which cleared the way for  russians to compete in tokyo though not in national uniform over the objections of antidoping officialsmany russians are just happy to see their gymnasts swimmers equestrians archers and other athletes have a shot at medals but on a darker note beating the doping restrictions for some russians also became something to cheer for this summerrussian propaganda and even some of the team members have been thumbing their noses at the doping regulators flimsy

russias baffling quest to create its own domestic internet  russias nonsensical impossible quest to create its own domestic internet            this article is part of the free speech project a collaboration between future tense and the tech law  security program at american university washington college of law that examines the ways technology is influencing how we think about speech        as a general rule when a country shuts off some or all of its connections to the global internet it doesnt need to announce the news people in that country notice when they cant access online services and people outside that country can quickly figure out that somethings going on when they stop receiving traffic from that country or being able to route traffic to servers and service providers in that country so it was pretty strange when russia decided to announce last week that it had successfully run tests between june  and july  to show it could disconnect itself from the internetthe tests seem to have gone largely unnoticed both in and outside of russia indicating that whatever they entailed they did not involve russia actually disconnecting from the global internet indeed its a little difficult to guess at what exactly the tests did involve given the vagueness of a report in the rbc daily the russian newspaper published an article on july  reporting that the month of tests had been a success citing documents from an information security working group that indicated all of the major telecom providers in russia had participated in the tests the exercises are supposed to be held annually but were canceled last year due to the pandemic and whatever went on this year definitely did not include russia disconnecting from the global internet for any prolonged period of time since that would be impossible to hide instead the testsand most of all the announcement about their successseem to be intended as some kind of signal that russia is no longer dependent on the rest of the world for its internet access but its not at all clear what that would even mean since russia is clearly still dependent on people and companies in other countries for access to the online content and services they create and hostjust as we all arefor the past two years ever since implementing its sovereign internet law in  russia has been talking about establishing its own domestic internet that does not rely on any infrastructure or resources located outside the country presumably the tests completed this summer are related to that goal of being able to operate a local internet within russia that does not rely on the global domain name system to map websites to specific ip addresses this is not actually a particularly ambitious goalany country could operate its own domestic internet with its own local addressing system if it wanted to do so instead of connecting to the larger global internet the one i would call the internet if i were still permitted by style guides to use a capital i in that wordand this is exactly why internet is grammatically important to distinguish between smaller local internetworks or internets like russias and the global public internet you are using to read this articlethe confusing thing about russias plans is it seems to want to be able to use its isolated russian internet to access the global internet so by design the tests of russias sovereign internet did not cause any interruption to its connection to the global internetbut its completely unclear what they actually did one source apparently told the russian newspaper rbc daily that the capability of physically disconnecting the russian part of the internet was tested but theres simply no way that russia could have physically disconnected its infrastructure from the rest of the world for any extended period of time without anyone noticingthe center for applied internet data analysis at the university of california san diego maintains an internet outage detection and analysis tool that combines three data sets to identify internet outages around the world it monitors the border gateway protocol that is used by internet service providers to exchange routing information as well as what ip addresses it is receiving traffic from and which addresses it is able to probe to figure out when parts of the internet become unreachable or go offline when there is an actual internet outage typically one or more of these indicators drops significantly because the region stops exchanging routing information with outside providers stops sending outbound traffic or stops receiving inbound traffic the data sets for russia from june  through july  the period of the supposed disconnection tests shows few indications of any actual disconnection other than a period around july  when unsolicited traffic from russia appears to have dropped offwhatever russia did this summer it did not physically disconnect from the global internet it doesnt even appear to have virtually disconnected from the global internet in any meaningful sense perhaps it shifted some of its critical infrastructure systems to rely more on domestic service providers and resources perhaps it created more local copies of the addressing system used to navigate the internet and tested its ability to rely on those perhaps it tested its ability to route online traffic within the country through certain chokepoints for purposes of better surveillance and monitoring none of those are activities that would be immediately visible from outside the country and all of them would be in line with russias stated goals of relying less on internet infrastructure outside its borders and strengthening its ability to monitor online activity        popular in                  technology        but the goal of being completely independent of the rest of the worlds internet infrastructure while still being able to access the global internet is a nonsensical and impossible one russia cannot both disconnect from the internet and still be able to use all of the online services and access all of the websites hosted and maintained by people in other parts of the world as appears to have been the case during the monthlong period of testing so its a little hard to know what to make of last weeks reports about the successful tests of the russian domestic internet if the announcement is meant as public posturing its not clear what message exactly its intended to send being able to disconnect your country from the internet is not all that difficultand certainly nothing to brag about but announcing that youve successfully disconnected from the internet when its patently clear that you havent suggests both profound technical incompetence and a deepseated uncertainty about what a domestic russian internet would actually meanfuture tense  is a partnership of  slate  new america and  arizona state  university  that examines emerging technologies public policy and societyslate is

the guardian navalny putins nemesis russias future review – slick slippery and bravean engaging academic study of alexei navalny paints a vivid picture of a russian politician who is a necessarily courageous product of the internet agein january alexei navalny boarded a flight to moscow russias most famous dissident had spent five months in germany recovering from the effects of novichok poisoning surrounded by journalists who travelled with him he was under no illusions as to what would happen once he swapped berlin for homethe russian authorities would arrest him for sure he would spend months years in prison probably he would never emerge on the plane navalny shrugged off these concerns with his usual dark humour i am not afraid he said he spent the flight watching his favourite show the us cartoon sitcom rick and mortywas navalnys decision to face down vladimir putin an act of supreme courage a modernday echo of the doomed revolt by the decembrists against autocratic rule or was it suicidal folly after all navalny embodies the best chance for democratic change inside russia since the crumbling of the ussras navalny had gambled his arrest in moscow sparked big protests against the kremlin demonstrators took to the squares of  towns and cities from occupied crimea to vladivostok they demanded his release but this notquite revolution never really threatened putins twodecade rule or dented his controlwhile navalny sits in jail putin appears ready to carry on as president well into his s security forces have quelled the street protests for now using timehonoured tactics brutal force mass arrests and enhanced persecution for a few more repression is under way dissent the message goes has nasty consequencesover the space of a few months the authorities have rolled up navalnys formidable anticorruption movement banning his countrywide network of local campaign offices they have shut down russias few remaining independent media outlets as well branding them foreign agents and undesirable free speech is in troublewith alarming speed russia is edging towards what the authors of a new study call fullblown dictatorship the three nonrussian academics – jan matti dollbaum morvan lallouet and ben noble – have written an engaging and timely book about navalny the man the politician and the protesterits subtitle asks putins nemesis russias future no one quite knows if navalny is indeed russias destiny or a tragic national footnote fated to be finished off by the same bungling fsb spy agency team that last summer tried to kill him in siberia poisoning his underpantsthe book convincingly argues that navalny is the most interesting and significant figure to emerge from the postcommunist period it traces his early career as a blogger and activist to his present status as putins globally recognised arch enemy and biggest headachenavalny is neither nelson mandela nor alexander solzhenitsyn the authors suggest instead he is himself inspiring complex charismatic brash and superbly mediasavvy and funny too his humour a cudgel used to bash his enemies above all navalny is a politician tactically flexible contradictory and polarisingborn in  navalny came from a generation that grew up in the ussr but was never defined by it in the s he worked as a lawyer and a stockbroker a rightwing probusiness punk according to friends he entered politics during the early putin era as a worker with the liberal yabloko partythe party expelled him in  after he joined a march of russian nationalists in moscow many of those attending were neonazi skinheads navalny once likened chechen terrorists to cockroaches and still advocates a visa regime for central asian guest workersdoes this make him racist navalny has never fully disavowed his early radical views though his platform these days is that of a mainstream proeuropean social democrat more left than right the book explains navalnys forays into nationalism by quoting his view that an opposition needs to be popular only then can it be effectiveit was navalnys campaign against rampant state corruption that got him noticed he probed the ownership of corporations and private companies such as the oil trader gunvor the us treasury says putin benefits from it the firm denies this when i met him in  navalny sketched out schemes for me on a giant whiteboardthe following year navalny addressed antigovernment rallies and came up with a memorable slogan for the ruling united russia party – the party of crooks and thieves he ran an impressive campaign to become moscow mayor winning a third of the vote then in  he launched fbk an anticorruption foundation this became his main political vehiclethe authors write well about the role played by corruption in russian politics they note that under putin stealing has shifted from being something that undermines state control into a tool for disciplining the elites everyone is complicit and therefore vulnerable to punitive criminal charges stealing is organised to buttress power the book assertsit adds that navalnys rise has only become possible because of the internet shut out from state tv and smeared in the kremlin media navalny has turned to the online world to get his ideas out he has developed an audience through slick youtube videos a daily show and instagram and twitter channels where he has m followers putin a technodinosaur doesnt use emailin his catandmouse battle with the authorities navalny has employed ingenious tactics his aides have flown drones over the palaces of russias venal kgb overlords the fbk investigation into dmitry medvedev russias onetime president and pm was a bravura piece of storytelling and sleuthing it began with medvedevs trainers and ended with lavish homes and a tuscan vineyardeven critics recognise navalny is courageous his blockbuster investigation into putins black sea palace was released just after his return to moscow navalny depicts putin in scathing terms as a smalltime bureaucrat who graduated from stealing cassette recorders as a junior spy in east germany to looting an entire country a thieving little man in a bunker in navalnys jibethe three academics say the kremlin takes the threat posed by navalny seriously it has jailed him on various occasions and filed criminal charges in  it blocked him from standing to be president last year an exasperated putin gave a secret order to have him killed navalny alleges two of the russian doctors who treated him for novichok poisoning have met mysterious deathsthus far putin has acted ruthlessly in quashing rivals but the book points out that his regime is adaptable and realistic it has worked hard to gain the support of ordinary russians and to build an emotional connection with them as navalny himself recognises putin is popular even with fair elections and a free media putin might just beat navalny in a headtohead pollnot that this will ever happen navalny has talked cheerfully about his previous stints behind bars saying that he gets to meet people from all walks of life and has an opportunity to read his supporters are convinced he will eventually prevail against an older generation obsessed with the ghosts of the past and soviet geopolitical fantasies maybe for now though his life hangs by a threadluke hardings shadow state murder

slashing the number of personnel staffing the us embassy and consulates by around  percent and leaving only a skeleton crew of us diplomats to manage relations with one of washingtons top geopolitical rivalsrussias decision to bar the us embassy and consulates from hiring foreign nationals was first announced in late april and it goes into effect on aug  the move will leave around  officials working in moscow with zero locally hired employees known as foreign service nationals this is down from roughly  us diplomats and  foreign service nationals operating the us embassy in moscow and

working for the us mission in the soontobe implemented restrictions illustrate how far usrussia relations have fallen in recent years even as the biden administration tries to keep the door for improving bilateral ties at least slightly cracked openas the aug  deadline approaches some us diplomats inside the state department are growing frustrated with the biden administration for not issuing a more forceful response to russias restrictions the biden administration has not signaled it will make any move to retaliate including by curtailing the number of russian diplomats posted at its consulates in houston or new york or its embassy in washingtonveteran diplomats and other experts say the new restrictions will all but destroy the us missions ability to carry out routine diplomatic work from political engagement to visa and consular services given how important local hires are to the daytoday functions of an embassy sullivan said in an interview last month that the last two remaining consulates in russia in yekaterinburg and in vladivostok will suspend operations due to the staff cutsscott rauland a former career us foreign service officer who had served as us consul general in yekaterinburg described it as a massive blow to us diplomacy in russia at the very least russia has succeeded in hobbling our entire diplomatic infrastructure there for the short term he said for those consulates it could take years to get them back and fully functional againheather conley an expert on russia and europe with the center for strategic and international studies said the new restrictions reflected a new low point in usrussia relationsdespite the souring in relations with moscow us president joe biden has attempted to reengage with the former cold war rival on some diplomatic fronts including arms control talks efforts to revive the iran nuclear deal and the future of afghanistan after the us military withdrawal notably biden has agreed to waive further us sanctions on a controversial russian gas pipeline to germany nord stream  in a bid meant to repair us ties with berlin but one that has also opened the president to attacks from republican lawmakers that he is too soft on russiabiden met with putin in june in geneva where biden called for a predictable and rational relationship with russia and sought to establish some basic rules of the road for how the two countries engage the summit came after biden in march sparked a diplomatic rift with putin when he called the russian president a killer russia recalled its us envoy anatoly antonov for consultations shortly after he returned to washington in junedespite these efforts many experts believe relations remain on a downward spiral with few if any offramps they point to a spate of highprofile cyberattacks on us infrastructure attributed to kremlinbacked hackers and mysterious health problems experienced by us diplomats and intelligence officials that some experts believe russian government operatives to be behindin a speech to us intelligence officials on tuesday biden asserted that putin is increasingly dangerous as his country declines on the world stage hes sitting on top of an economy that has nuclear weapons and oil wells and nothing else nothing else biden said their economy iswhatthe eighth smallest in the world nowlargest in the world he knowshe knows hes in real trouble which makes him even more dangerous in my viewwith only a fraction of the staff it once had conley said the us embassy will struggle to perform most basic diplomatic functions as it tries to manage increasingly strained ties between the two countries its really crippling us reporting capabilities across russia and preventing us from understanding whats happening there and its also crippling our ability to maintain peopletopeople contacts which is so essential when our governments are struggling in their relationship she saidthe state department did not respond to several requests for comment for this storyrauland as well several other current diplomats who spoke to foreign policy on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to speak to the media described foreign service nationals as crucial to an embassy or consulates daytoday operations and a vital conduit for us diplomats to local populationsmost us diplomatic outposts rely heavily on local employees for daytoday operations they provide everything from language and translation skills to cultural advice to administrative work and plumbing and electricity maintenancewhere it really hurts is there will be no local experts to advise american officers on complex political and economic issues rauland said foreign service officers come and go every few years but the local staff are the

near afghanistan russia against us troops in central asia near afghanistanmoscow ap  russia has strongly warned the united states against deploying its troops in the former soviet central asian nations following their withdrawal from afghanistan a senior diplomat said in remarks published on tuesdayrussias deputy foreign minister sergei ryabkov said that moscow conveyed the message to washington during russian president vladimir putins summit with us president joe biden in geneva last month the warning comes as the us military said last week that  of the withdrawal of us troops and equipment from afghanistan is complete biden said the us military mission in afghanistan will conclude on aug i would emphasize that the redeployment of the american permanent military presence to the countries neighboring afghanistan is unacceptable ryabkov said we told the americans in a direct and straightforward way that it would change a lot of things not only in our perceptions of whats going on in that important region but also in our relations with the united stateshe added that russia has also issued the warning to central asian nationswe cautioned them against such steps and we also have had a frank talk on the subject with our central asian allies neighbors and friends and also other countries in the region that would be directly affected ryabkov said in an interview published in the mezhdunarodnaya zhizn magazineon monday russian foreign minister sergey lavrov emphasized that kazakhstan kyrgyzstan and tajikistan are all members of the collective security treaty organization and any presence of foreign troops on their territories must be endorsed by the security pact he added that none of those countries have raised the issuetajikistan and kyrgyzstan both host russian military bases kyrgyzstan which hosted a us military base that supported operations in afghanistan closed it in uzbekistan which also hosted a us base ordered it shut in  amid tensions with washington uzbekistans defense ministry reaffirmed in may that the countrys constitution and its military doctrine rule out the presence of any foreign troops on its territoryi dont think that the emergence of new american military facilities in central asia would promote security in the region lavrov saidthe biden administration has reportedly considered uzbekistan and tajikistan that border afghanistan as well as kazakhstan as possible staging areas for monitoring and quickly responding to possible security problems that may follow the us militarys withdrawal from afghanistan i dont think that anyone is interested in becoming a hostage to such us policy and intentions and in inviting retaliation lavrov saidthe russian foreign minister questioned what results would be achieved with a small us presence outside afghanistan when a strong nato force inside the country failed to do anythingmost probably they simply want to ensure their military presence in central asia and be able to influence the situation in this region as the american and nato troops were swiftly pulling out the taliban have made quick gains across the country they claimed on friday that they now control  of afghanistans territoryrussian officials have expressed concern that the taliban surge could destabilize central asiataliban advances already have forced hundreds of afghan soldiers to flee across the border into tajikistan which called up  military reservists to strengthen its southern border with afghanistan last week a senior taliban delegation visited moscow to offer assurances that

made of russias use of all elements of statecraft including diplomatic ideological military and economic instruments to advance its interests in this region a vital shipping and transit corridor a closer look at russias economic tool kit in this region however suggests concerns about russian economic capabilities are likely overstatedrussias most important economic tools in the mediterranean are its energy resources arms exports and ability to launder money through corrupt networks these tools have complemented russias diplomatic and military activities particularly in areas where economic systems and rule of law have been weaker where russia has been successful it has increased a countrys dependence on russian money oil and gas andor arms giving it a say in a countrys policymaking particularly on matters of importance to russia and a way to undermine us and the north atlantic treaty organizations nato influence in the regionin particular russias unique economic tools have helped it manage its otherwise difficult relationship with turkey which depends on russian oil and gas and is a new customer for russian nuclear power and weapons systems turkey is a unique example in the mediterranean where russia already had a substantial trade and investment relationship beyond hydrocarbons and then used these newer more subversive tools to build its influence these same tools have allowed russia to gain more influence in egypt algeria and to some degree cyprus over the last decadethese tools have proved of limited utility elsewhere however as they have not been backed by the traditional instruments of economic statecraft trade in nonenergy goods and services foreign direct investment and development assistance russia has trailed the united states and europe and in some cases china in deploying these fundamental economic elements of foreign policy in the mediterranean region based on economic data available russias bilateral trade with individual mediterranean countries is low its investment levels in most mediterranean countries are insubstantial and it is not giving large quantities of development assistance to the poorer countries along the mediterraneans eastern and southern rims the lack of these traditional economic ties is surprising given russias military and diplomatic efforts to increase its influence in the region without them russias economic diplomacy in the region is highly based on symbolism and the relationships lack sustainability over the long term which undercuts its geopolitical ambitions in the mediterraneanif russias ambitions in the mediterranean region are limited to maintaining access currying favor with key decisionmakers and remaining a nuisance to nato then its current level of economic ties is likely sufficient if russia aims to grow its influence and clout with more countries in the region however its current economic tool kit does not appear to be large or sophisticated enough to achieve thiseconomic statecraft is an important tool in any countrys foreign policy trade and investment deals link countries together in vital ways to improve living standards in each country they also build relationships between peoplepoliticians business leaders students touriststhat promote mutual understanding and respect for each others cultures the united states and the european union eu have generally excelled in building these types of economic ties in the post–world war ii era and economic data show they continue to be the dominant economic powers in the mediterranean continuing this leadership in the economy will likely ensure that russian influence in the mediterranean remains a manageable if persistent problem for the westfor nearly a decade now russia has pursued a more aggressive foreign policy seeking to return to countries and regions beyond its immediate neighborhood where it has been absent since the end of the cold war one such region is the mediterranean where it has used a variety of tools to expand its influence in the littoral countries of this critical transit corridor for global shipping and trade with the black sea the mediterranean is russias critical outlet to the worlds oceans and it has long been a major arena of its geopolitical and commercial pursuits while russia pulled back from the region at the end of the cold war to focus on its domestic problems its intervention in syria in  and then in libya marked its return as a major actor in the region much has been made of russia using all elements of statecraft including diplomatic ideological military and economic instruments in pursuit of its goals in the mediterranean however a closer look at its economic tool kit suggests concerns about its capabilities are overstatedrussias most important economic tools in the mediterranean are its energy resources arms exports and money laundering through corrupt networks these tools have complemented russias diplomatic and military activities particularly in the middle east north africa and the balkans where russia has been successful it has increased dependence on its money oil and gas andor arms giving it a say in a countrys policymaking particularly on matters of importance to russia and a way to undermine us and nato influence in the region these tools have proved of limited utility however as they have not been backed by other traditional means of economic statecraft such as trade in nonenergy goods and services foreign direct investment and development assistance russia has trailed the united states and europe and in some cases china in deploying these more fundamental economic instruments of foreign policy in the mediterranean without them russias relationships lack sustainability over the long term which undercuts its geopolitical ambitions in the regionthe largest economic tool russia can bring to bear in the mediterranean or anywhere is its vast supply of oil and natural gas energy exports have consistently totaled half of its export earnings worldwide russia has used its position as the key oil and gas supplier repeatedly against its closest neighbors such as ukraine through rewards and punishment to keep them in line with its policy choices in the mediterranean however where russia does not have a monopoly on energy supplies as in many of the former soviet states energy is an important lever but not necessarily an instrument of coercion maintaining and expanding influence in the energy field require continuous effort by russia to expand its network of gas pipelines as well as gaining footholds in new gas development projects with new gas discoveries in the eastern mediterranean and large although diminishing demand for oil and gas throughout the region energy politics are central to russias tools of statecraft in the regionnot all mediterranean countries import russian gas as distance andor local supplies make russian piped gas costprohibitive or unnecessary these factors force russia to focus on southern europe but it must do so with turkey serving as a central node and partner especially since its previous efforts to build pipeline infrastructure around the country have come to naught the kremlin has been remarkably successful in maintaining increasingly close energy cooperation with ankara despite being on opposite sides of three different regional conflicts in recent years largely by compartmentalizing disagreements and playing to president recep tayyip erdoğans disenchantment with the west and ambitions to make turkey a regional gas distribution hegemon russianturkish energy cooperation has led to the completion of several largescale pipeline projects beginning with the blue stream pipeline which was completed in  new pipeline projects have increased turkeys consumption of russian gas while allowing russia to bypass ukraine to send gas to southern european destinationsa clear win for both countries as of january  when the turkstream pipeline across the black sea began operations turkey stopped receiving russian gas through the transbalkan pipeline from ukraine which it had done since the mids the second phase of turkstream envisions extending the pipeline through bulgaria all the way to hungary weakening ukraines position as a transit state and transforming turkey into a more important node for gas deliveries to europe again a win for both moscow and ankarastill the example of turkey illustrates the limits of natural gas as a lever of influence for russia the shale gas revolution has drastically brought down the cost of natural gas reducing the revenues russia can gain from gas sales while the eus third energy package has limited its monopoly power over gas distribution according to data from the bank of russia the countrys revenues from global gas exports peaked in  at  billion and they have not returned to near that level since with the global recession spurred by the covid pandemic in  bringing the total down to  billion a level not seen since  see figure  moreover the spread of liquefied natural gas lng technology allows countries to import gas from anywhere free from a dependency on pipelines that are costly to build and maintain by expanding its use of lng as the thirdlargest importer in the world in  turkey no longer has to rely solely on piped gas from russia azerbaijan and iran but is diversifying its supply from at least seven new partners including increasing volumes from the united states in  russia remained turkeys largest gas supplier at  billion cubic meters but imports of gas from the united states grew by  percent to  billion cubic meters see figure  turkey also has longterm contracts for lng with algeria and nigeria moreover by becoming a central node in russias gas distribution system turkey gains the same leverage ukraine used in the pastthe ability to negotiate down the price it pays for its own imports in order to allow russian gas to flow through its territory and on to the rest of europe taken together these steps have reduced russias ability to use gas as political leverage with turkey even if they have not eliminated it moreover cooperation on gas projects is in the interests of both countries as they look to expand their influence in southeastern europerussian gas companies have also expanded aggressively into new markets in the mediterranean offering financing and expertise to develop new fields in  russias gazprom began oil and gas exploration in algeria after signing a memorandum of understanding in  with algerias stateowned sonatrach the partnership has confirmed reserves in the elassel basin through exploratory wells but has not yet begun commercial production in  russias rosneft purchased a  percent stake in the zohr gas field off egypt other partners are italys eni at  percent bp at  percent and the united arab emirates mubadala petroleum also at  percent the largest discovered in the mediterranean production at zohr has exceeded the joint ventures expectations reaching  billion cubic feet per day by august  russian firm novatek has a  percent stake in a consortium along with frances total and italys eni to explore lebanons offshore fields the agreement was signed in  but production has not yet started these deals ensure russia remains a key player in all gas discussions in the mediterraneanwhile natural gas gets most of the attention oil and oil products constitute around  percent of russias energy income with piped and liquefied natural gas contributing  percent oil is the largest source of funds for russias state budget including its foreign policy adventures all twentyone mediterranean littoral states have imported some oil from russia since  although not all in substantial quantities european countries as the largest economies of the region are the largest consumers of russian oil but the countries in the eastern mediterranean and north africa have generally purchased less than – million worth annuallydependence on russian oil might at one time have been a lever of political influence in some european countries of the region but the mediterranean is of declining importance to russia as a customer in  mediterranean countries consumed  percent of russias oil exports in  this figure was  percent the drop comes largely from european countries reducing their consumption see figure  the reduction in imports of russian oil was likely marketdriven rather than geopolitically motivated as oil is a widely traded commodity whose price fell substantially after  mandates to move toward cleaner energy sources and fewer emissions have also driven down the eus demand for oil and will continue to do so over the coming decades overall the substantial drop in europes demand for russian oil lessens the potential impact of this arrow in russias quiveranother key part of russias economic influence tool kit globally is the conclusion of deals to build nuclear power plants abroad the russian national security establishment views civilian nuclear power exports as an important tool for projecting influence as well as creating revenue streams for sustaining intellectual and technical capabilities and vital programs in russia nuclear power plants are expensive however and not without risk they can be of dubious value to the host government or saddle the state nuclear power monopoly rosatom with debts it cannot collect therefore russia has more often than not overpromised and underdelivered when signing agreements to build nuclear plants most are never fully implemented the mediterranean which has plentiful conventional energy resources has not been a major target of russias nuclear ambitions on the european rim france and spain have domestically owned nuclear programs and both have committed to reducing nuclear power while italy shuttered its program after the chernobyl disaster in rosatom has signed agreements however with turkey and egypt for large nuclear plant projects turkey signed its agreement in  under which rosatom will build own and operate the countrys first nuclear power plant at akkuyu which will have a total capacity of  megawatts mw this model means rosatom will have a longterm presence at akkuyu with nearcomplete operational control over the plant the company plans to open the first unit of the fourunit plant in  in time for the hundredth anniversary of the turkish republic in the case of egypts plant which is also supposed to deliver  mw the countrys authorities will operate it after construction but russia will have a longterm role in training egyptian workers and providing and disposing of fuel while egypt has sought to build a nuclear power plant for decades the decision to sign with rosatom in  over bids from us chinese french and south korean firms lacked transparency and observers suspect it may have been taken as a step to encourage russia to restart tourism to egypt which russia had halted earlier in the year egypt has contracted with us firm general electric and with australian consultancy worley ltd for other parts of the project however approximately  percent of the financing for the plant will come from a  billion loan from russia and some in egypt have said the plant is unnecessary given that the country has an electricity surplus with its current supply sources construction has not yet begun like other rosatom projects around the globe the turkish and egyptian nuclear power plants appear to be geopolitical projects of somewhat dubious economic merit but it seems unlikely russia would be able to replicate this model elsewhere in the mediterraneancontinuing its decadeslong legacy russia was the worlds secondlargest exporter of arms after the united states between  and  according to the stockholm international peace research institute sipri it accounted for  percent of all arms exported during this period russias arms sales provide it direct engagement with foreign countries leaders relationshipbuilding tools with their militaries and profits for its armsproducing enterprises this is a major tool russia uses for influence in the mediterranean but with most of the northern littoral states being nato members its armssales relationships focus on the eastern and southern ones see figure of these countries algeria egypt and turkey deserve special mention algeria remains russias largest client in the mediterranean having been one since soviet times between  and  it was also the largest arms importer in africa and the sixthlargest in the world importing  percent of all the arms imported globally during this period given algerias demand for weapons and its ability to pay for them maintaining market share in the country has been a priority for russia in the region in  moscow agreed to write off  billion in debt from the soviet era in exchange for algeria signing  billion in new contracts for weapons purchases following this deal russia supplied over  percent of algerias imported arms from  to  starting in  however algeria began to diversify its imports concluding deals with france italy germany and even china for ships and accompanying weapons armored personnel carriers and armed unmanned aerial vehicles as delivery on these contracts was made russias market share dropped to  percent between  and  after  russia worked diligently to regain its position selling and transferring sixteen combat aircraft fortytwo combat helicopters and two submarines to algeria through  maintaining market dominance is important to russia but this volatility suggests that it cannot rely on past sales to remain competitive even in its key marketsegypt is a newer success story for russia the united states reduced arms sales to the country during and after the arab spring eventually freezing arms exports in the wake of the military taking over the government in  that embargo lasted two years until the multiple ongoing conflicts in the middle east forced then us president barack obamas administration to reverse course russia filled this gap left by the united states and rapidly expanded its arms sales to egypt arms contracts in general take time between signature and delivery so the effect of this increased procurement from russia can be seen in arms transfer data starting only in  when russia and the united states transferred roughly an equal value of weapons to egypt see figure  since then the value of russias supplies has exceeded that of the united states and has included fifty combat aircraft and fortysix shipborne combat helicopters these sales have also led to closer military cooperation including joint exercises while president joe bidens administration has announced it will continue to supply egypt with arms despite concerns over human rights abuses the previous years of delay created an opening for russia and a desire on the part of egyptian leadership to diversify away from just one supplierturkey is also a success story for russias arms sales strategy as a longstanding nato ally turkey did not purchase russian arms between  and  other than some secondhand armored personnel carriers and helicopters in the early s to be used by the police instead turkey imported arms only from other nato allies and developed its own arms industry according to sipri from  to  turkey dropped from being the sixthlargest arms importer to the twentieth due to the development of its own defense industry yet in  it agreed to purchase the s missile defense system from russia over the strong objections of the united states and other nato allies at the same time the usturkish relationship had deteriorated over differences on cooperation with syrian kurdish forces the  attempted coup in turkey and the subsequent us refusal to extradite cleric fetullah gülen as well as washingtons reluctance to sell patriot air defense systems on turkish terms turkey felt the united states and nato had done little to help it reduce its vulnerability to attack from the conflict in syria moscow capitalized on this frustration with the west and vulnerability to russias role in syria to offer the s system which erdoğan quickly accepted this sale was a clever move to drive a wedge between turkey and its nato allies as the united states was forced to respond by removing turkey from the f fighter jet program for fear of release of sensitive technology to russia through the s system discussions reportedly continue between the turkish government and the biden administration on a path forward on the issue of the s system which turkey has tested but which is not yet in full use in this case the sale of a weapons system met russias economic military and geostrategic goals in one tidy packagea model russia likely will look to replicate elsewhere if the right factors are presentrussia is frequently accused of using illicit financial transfers corruption and other organized criminal activity as economic tools of influence although it is generally difficult to link alleged illicit financial transfers from russia directly to its government in many cases they can be traced to individuals companies and other russianowned networks with ties to the russian state through moneylaundering schemes funds obtained illegally in russia can be moved out of the country and then used to buy real estate or other legitimate goods and services transferring them into what otherwise appear to be legal assets such dirty money or even clean money transferred out of the country can be used to fund corruption or other illicit dealings in the destination country that further russias geopolitical interestsin the mediterranean there are numerous examples of allegedly illicit russian money flowing to both legitimate and illicit businesses particularly along the northern littoral states one of russian opposition politician alexey navalnys anticorruption movies centers on the luxury pomegranate hotel in greece which he alleges is owned by artem chaika the son of yuriy chaika who was russias prosecutor general until  and by olga lopatina the exwife of deputy prosecutor general gennady lopatin in  navalny accused the two chaikas of owning a network of criminal enterprises across russia and that the pomegranate hotel was just one of the enterprises they used to launder the proceeds navalny also accused lopatina of connections to an organized criminal gang and claimed she owned a large villa near the hotelin the notorious laundromat scheme allegedly involving moneylaundering of over  billion the money was funneled out of russia to many countries around the world including some in the mediterranean according to the organized crime and corruption reporting project occrp cyprus turkey and italy were the end destination for large sums of this money with other smaller recipients in the region including slovenia france spain greece croatia and egypt while the occrp was not able to track the owners of all the bank accounts involved it found that the main users of the scheme were wealthy russian businessmen who had made their fortunes through connections to the governmentrussian money has no larger destination in the mediterranean than cyprus the countrys low tax rate double taxation treaty with russia anduntil recentlylow diligence on the source of funds made it a top destination for russian money since the end of the soviet union at the time of cypruss financial crisis in  there was an estimated  billion in russian cash in cypriot banks more than the countrys annual gross domestic product gdp at the time russian bank loans to russianowned companies registered in cyprus totaled another – billion by another estimate russia was the source of  percent of inward and outward foreign direct investment fdi flows in cyprus at the time as russians roundtripped their money between the two countries russians lost billions of euros in the bailout of cyprus that followed the  financial crisis but the eus bailout conditions converted some of those losses into shares in cypriot banks unintentionally giving some control over these banks to the russians the eu had been trying to force outeven after the large losses from the  financial crisis russian money continues to flow to cyprus after it in order to boost the economy the government offered a golden passport scheme for those investing at least  million in the country russians accounted for nearly half of the  passports awarded between  and  under the scheme including some individuals who are now sanctioned by the united states and the eu after a review of the program cyprus began the process of revoking the citizenship it gave to twentyeight individuals but their identity has not been made public according to data published by the bank of russia in  russias fdi in cyprus was  percent of all of its fdi positions globally some of this investment is then transferred to other parts of the eu making it more difficult to trace back to russia the russian money going in and out of cyprus has included legitimate transfers and some that funded criminal activity such as money stolen from the russian treasury and funneled through the nowshuttered fbme bank in cyprus and then used to fund the production of chemical weapons in syriaanalysts have long worried about the leverage these vast flows of money and people give russia over cypruss policymaking and politicians certainly adding russians to the countrys voter rolls can have an impact on future elections or on how decisions are made inside the government and russian emigrés have started a political party in the country to do so in one small example the anticorruption activist and former owner of hermitage capital in russia bill browder has accused a cypriot government official of helping a russian mobster launder his money through a property purchase in cyprus in a larger one there have been no arrests to date in the fbme bank case while cyprus has not blocked the eus semiannual renewal of sanctions on russia for its aggression in ukraine as some feared decisions such as the  deal allowing russian naval ships to access the countrys ports are evidence of the leverage russian money can haveefforts by the eu and the united states to push cyprus to improve its anti–money laundering practices have worked to some extent as a  report on its compliance with financial action task force regulations showed the report concluded that several measures had been deployed since the previous  report to deal with the major money laundering and terrorism financing threats facing the country and that the banking sector had become more effective in mitigating these risks still the report highlighted that the authorities must do more to pursue the proceeds of criminal activity generated outside cyprus which it identified as the largest threat to its financial system cyprus also missed the january  deadline to translate the eus fifth anti–money laundering directive into domestic legislation after a rebuke from the european commission the parliament finally passed the required legislation in february  but it is too soon to evaluate how these changes will be implemented this indicates that the flows of russian money remain alluring to cypruss policymakers who continue to struggle with balancing its rule of law commitments as an eu member state with the desire for foreign funding to grow its economywhile russia has used energy weapons sales and money laundering to build influence in several mediterranean countries it does not have or has not been able to use as effectively the normal major tools of economic statecraft such as trade in nonenergy goods and services foreign direct investment and development assistance to build leverage in the region limited economic growth in russia along with its relatively small postsoviet industrial base leaves little room for building deep trade and investment relationships abroad low levels of domestic investment in large part due to weak rule of law and little respect for property rights as well as fiscal austerity mean russia does not have enough resources to spur growth at home real gdp in russia has grown on average by an anemic  percent annually between  and  and the covid pandemic is estimated to have shrunk the economy by a further  percent in  gross national income per capita began to fall after  russia is substantially poorer on a per capita basis than all the eu member states on the northern shores of the mediterranean see figure  living standards in russia are roughly on par with those in turkey but are higher than those in the countries on the southern coast of the mediterraneanrussias government has relatively large foreign currency reserves built up over the past two decades it could use some of these to fund development projects abroad but thus far it has not done so falling international oil prices and western financial sanctions ended russias decade of massive balance of payments surpluses – and the government is no longer accumulating foreign currency reserves at the rate it previously did see figure  still these boom years and the tight fiscal policies of president vladimir putins administration left the russian government with little foreign debt  percent of gdp in  and a large sovereign wealth fund low debt and large reserves are walls of a fortress that help protect the economy from international shocks such as new sanctions but they also keep it isolated from the rest of the world and cause growth to stagnate these isolationist choices limit the power of russias economic tool kit in the mediterranean when compared to other actors in the region russia simply does not produce much of the goods and services consumers in the region want and other than nuclear power plants it does not have the technology and resources to compete with china or the west on major infrastructure dealsrussias trade statistics do not indicate a country promoting trade as a major tool for building up dependence and influence globally or in the countries of the mediterranean the percentage of russias gdp derived from exports fell between  and  reaching a low of  percent see figure  since  it has been essentially flat the rate of imports has also been constant at around  percent of gdp since  hydrocarbons dominate this limited trade as discussed above beyond these russia exports mostly primary commodities precious metals and stones iron and steel cereals rather than more advanced manufactured goods that a global economic powerhouse would normally export see figure the twentyone states of the mediterranean have played a declining but still important role in russias limited trade while in  they accounted for  percent of russias total global trade by  that share had shrunk to  percent the drop comes almost entirely from a steep decline in the value of russias trade with italy after  when the eu and russia imposed sanctions on each other in response to russias military aggression against ukraine and simultaneously the price of oil went into a steep decline by  turkey overtook italy as russias largest trading partner in the mediterranean and each country accounted for just under  percent to russias total trade in  other than with italy the share of each mediterranean country in russias trade has remained consistent indicating trade is not becoming a more important part of its influence tool kit in the regionif trade between russia and a mediterranean country were particularly onesided or concentrated in a specific vital industry in russias favor this would give it an important tool for influence however the three largest economies in the regionfrance italy and spainas well as portugal and slovenia have trade surpluses with russia see figure  fifteen other mediterranean countries have a consistent trade deficit with russia however turkey and egypt have the largest trade deficits and therefore deserve a deeper examination as does the change in italys trade with russia since while sovietturkish trade was roughly balanced throughout the cold war after the russian financial crisis in  turkeys energy imports from russia surpassed the amount of goods russia could afford to buy from turkey this pattern in goods trade has continued through the putinerdoğan period with oil and gas exports from russia to turkey consistently worth twenty times any single import category from turkey the size of the trade deficit narrows but remains significant if services are included as russia is consistently in deficit to turkey in trade in services by  billion in  consisting mostly of russian tourism to turkey  billion in  exports and construction services  billion in  exports in addition to these two sectors turkey exports mostly fruit but also machinery and passenger vehicles to russia when a political crisis erupted between the two countries in  after turkey shot down a russian fighter jet on its border with syria moscow turned to trade sanctions on fruit and tourism to punish ankara while there was a cost to russia for these measures turkey took the bigger hit forcing erdoğan to apologize for the incident in april  russia imposed another tourism ban on turkey likely to signal discontent over turkish support to ukraine turkeys trade deficit with russia continues to be a political vulnerability and is likely to continue to be a valuable influence tool for moscowturkey is the exception however that proves russias lack of trade power in the rest of the mediterranean it is not clear that russia could pull off a similar policy victory through trade sanctions against any other mediterranean country for example egypts smaller trade deficit with russia comes not from hydrocarbons but from wheat purchases egypt imports  percent of its wheat from russia the largest supplier for the country but egypt also accounts for  percent of russias wheat exports making it the secondlargest importer for russian producers were moscow to cut off wheat exports to egypt as a political measure it would discover as turkey found with russias ban on its fruit that finding new markets quickly for a vast amount of perishable exports is not easy therefore such a move would likely be equally harmful to russia as it would be to egypt and not a useful tool of influence in addition egypt used to earn over  billion annually from russian tourism but russia stopped all charter flights to the country in late  after a terrorist incident on a charter flight this cut tourism revenues from russia to essentially zero but it did little to change the political dynamic between the countries despite billions of dollars in lost revenue for egypt the two countries announced in april  they would restart the flights the timing of the announcement however seemed linked less to improved safety measures at egyptian airports than to the dynamics of russias relationship with turkey as it coincided with the latest tourism ban on the countryrussias trade with italy shows how vulnerable its reliance on hydrocarbons makes it in the larger global trading space the two countries had rather balanced trade until  when the value of the oil and gas italy imported from russia exceeded the amount of mostly manufactured goods and machinery russia could afford to buy from italy given the global financial crisis see figure  as the price of oil and gas fell after  however the trade values returned to more of a balanceover the long run as italy and the rest of europe turn away from fossil fuels and the eastern mediterranean develops its own energy resources russia will be left with a commodity of less and less value to trade for the highquality goods it currently imports from italy and europe without investment to grow and modernize its manufacturing sector russias trade surplus with the mediterranean is likely to shrink over time giving it less leverage over the region therefore trade is not and likely never will be a coercive tool for russia in the mediterraneanas with trade the statistics for its fdi do not indicate that russia is using investment as a major economic tool of influence in the mediterranean whose countries looking for investment are likely to link their economies to more active partners russian firms invest abroad at a lower rate compared to their countrys gdp than us ones do see figure  this rate has grown since  but not consistently it is also misleading as an overall indicator as between – percent of total russian fdi is in cyprus leaving little to invest elsewhere although some of this money does leave cyprus for other destinationsother than in cyprus russian fdi in most mediterranean countries is tiny even when compared to the size of the host economies and is dwarfed in almost all cases by us and eu investment one notable exception to this however is montenegro in  russia was the largest foreign investor in the country with its total investment equaling  percent of the countrys gdp down from a peak of  percent in  this investment is concentrated in real estate and tourism infrastructure tourism generally accounts for  percent of montenegros annual gdp and a visafree regime allows russians to be the largest source of tourists to the country as of  however russians are not heavily invested in other industries in  russian oligarch oleg deripaskas central european aluminium company bought the podgorica aluminium plant at that time the largest employer in the country which then went bankrupt in  this lack of industrial investment contrasts sharply with newer chinese investment in montenegro which is focused on highway construction and the rehabilitation of a thermal power plant allowing china to overtake russia as the largest investor in the country in  even at its peak however the high level of russian investment in montenegro was unable to influence its geopolitical directiondespite moscows attempt to foment a coup in  the country has joined nato and it has also stood with ukraine in its conflict with russia if russias outsized importance for montenegros economy could not change the countrys policy orientation russian fdi is unlikely to be a significant source of leverage in other countries of the regionofficial development assistance is not a major tool of russian policy in the mediterranean the soviet union was masterful at using its large development assistance budget to exercise influence abroad for example to shape votes at the united nations or to support ideologically compatible countries after the breakup of the soviet union economic collapse in the s turned russia into a net recipient of financial aid rather than a donor this situation was reversed in the mids when booming energy export revenues allowed it to once again join the ranks of donor nationsas with other donor nations russia supplies the organisation for economic cooperation and development oecd with data on its assistance but this data is not as complete as that provided by others still the data gives some insights into its development assistance in  the latest year for which detailed data is available  percent of russias  million in bilateral aid was in the form of debt relief with only  percent as country programmable aid or the type of assistance that is directed at specific programs and projects by comparison the average for country programmable aid among oecd members was  percent in  of all mediterranean countries only syria and the west bank and gaza were listed as receiving any russian aid each with  million see figure  by not providing them with more development assistance russia is missing an opportunity to build goodwill in the countries on the eastern and southern shores of the mediterranean especially as they need economic development more than they need the weapons systems it does provide them with and that only perpetuate the regions conflictsrussia does not appear to be using the traditional forms of economic statecraft to build influence in the mediterranean its nonenergy trade with the regions countries is low its investments in most of them are insubstantial and it does not give large quantities of development assistance to the countries that need it the lack of such economic ties is surprising given russias military and diplomatic efforts to increase its influence in the regionrussia has succeeded however in using the strengths it does possessenergy resources weapons industry and money launderingto develop some key relationships in the region in particular its unique economic tools have helped it manage a difficult relationship with turkey which depends on its oil and gas and is a new customer for its nuclear power and weapons systems these same tools have allowed russia to build more influence in egypt algeria and to some degree cyprus over the last decade if russias ambitions in the region are limited to maintaining access currying favor with key decisionmakers and remaining a nuisance to nato then its current level of economic ties is likely sufficient for these goals if russia aims to grow its influence and clout with more countries in the region however its current economic tool kit does not appear to be large or sophisticated enough to achieve thiseconomic statecraft is an important tool in any countrys foreign policy trade and investment deals link countries together in vital ways to grow living standards for the people of each country they also build relationships between peoplepoliticians business leaders studentsthat promote mutual understanding and respect for each others cultures the united states and europe have generally excelled in building these types of economic ties and economic data show they continue to be the dominant economic powers in the mediterranean with wideranging and diverse ties sustaining this leading economic position will likely ensure that russian influence in the mediterranean remains a manageable if persistent problem for the westthe author is a visiting scholar at the

the middle east egypt enrolls russian imams in fatwa training program to combat brotherhoodcairo  egypt has recently stepped up its support for russia in the fight against extremist ideologies and groups most notably the muslim brotherhood on aug  egypts dar alifta the egyptian authority responsible for issuing religious edicts announced the graduation of  imams from russia from a training camp on the issuance of fatwas against extremist ideologiesdar alifta said in a report on its portal on the same day that the training program for russian imams aims to provide them with the ability to issue fatwas while adhering to the moderate approach of islam and to monitor and analyze extremist ideasin a statement onaug  the mufti of moscow and the chief imam of the moscow cathedral mosque ildar alyautdinov said the fatwa training program has been very beneficial for russias imams the egyptian dar alifta was keen through this training to graduate russian muftis who are well aware of the importance and seriousness of fatwas and the correct methods to issue moderate fatwasalyautdinov explained that the graduates of this training program will serve russian muslims in various regions and republics across russia since they were selected from various places covering all russian republicsthe director of the training department at dar alifta amr alwardani noted in a press statement on aug  that the training program for russian imams included  sessions with two sessions per dayover the course of  days he indicated the training curriculum included sciences related to the formation of the mufti at the sharia and civil levelsto reflect the image of moderate and tolerant islamthe dar alifta training program included one russian woman named kavalova elina who works as a sharia researcher she was trained on confronting extremist ideas among russian female citizensegypt and russia share a hostile stance against the muslim brotherhood both countries have listed it as a bannedterrorist group the russian ambassador to cairo georgy borisenko had said in a press statementback in june  that the muslim brotherhood has been banned in russia since  well before egypt didhe asserted that the brotherhood cannot carry out any events in russia and will be dealt with according to the criminal law if it doesin december  egypt declared the muslim brotherhood a legally prohibited terrorist groupmuslims in russia number around  millionout of the countrys total population of  million citizensmeanwhile the spiritual administration of muslims of russia is working to confront extremism and extremist groups in russia it issued more than  books to confront the danger of extremism and respond to extremist groups in the countryin december  egypts grand mufti shawki allam signed with the spiritual administration of muslims of russia a memorandum of understanding and cooperation between the two countries allam explained back then that the agreement aims to form partnerships to spread moderation and combat extremist ideology publish and translate books and hold scientific meetings aimed to confront the ideology of extremism and terrorismin the same month the egyptian dar alifta organized its first online training course for russian imams and members of the council of muftis in russia the twoday training also aimed to confront extremism and radical ideas espoused and spread by extremist groups in russiamore recently on july  the russian cultural center in egypt organized a symposium to combat extremist ideology it was attended by a number of scholars of dar alifta and a russian religious delegation at the conclusion of the symposium alyautdinov said extremism in egypt is similar to that existing in russia he stressed that there is a cooperation protocol with egypts alazhar to fight extremism in both countrieshisham abdel aziz secretarygeneral of the egyptian supreme council for islamic affairs who also attended the symposium said the symposium is the outcome of cooperation between egyptian and russian scholars in order to combat extremist ideology and spread moderate thoughtin early  alazhar expressed its readiness to provide scholarships and training camps for imams and preachers from russia in a meeting back then with a delegation from the members of the russian muftis shura council alazhar undersecretary sheikh saleh abbas praised the strong relationship between russia and egypt he stressed his countrys readiness to provide all means of support for muslims in russia whether through scholarships oralazhar academy for training imams and preachers to confront extremismamr eldeeb a professor at the institute of international relations and world history at the russian lobachevsky university told almonitor russia has had its shares of terrorist and extremist operations and has great experience in dealing with extremist groups in generalrussia is one of the first countries in the world to put the muslim brotherhood on the list of banned organizations eldeeb noted russian security leaders are well aware of the danger the group poses on security and stabilityhe argued that sending russian imams to study in countries that adopted radical salafi thought contributed to the spread of extremist ideology in russia these imams returned to their homeland imbued with extremist ideas that russia is trying to fight he saideldeeb added russia made a shift by sending its muslim students to study at alazhar in egypt it wants to benefit from the moderation of alazhar this falls in the best interests of both cairo and moscow in their war against terrorist and extremist ideology most notablythe brotherhood ideologysheikh khaled emran secretarygeneral for fatwas at dar alifta told almonitor the training programs for russian imams focus on a primary goal which is to promote moderate discourse and the foundations of coexistence in society and to discuss and monitor extremist ideasemran added the russian imams have been trained to acquire the skill of responding to confronting and refuting these extremist ideasthe training of russian imams included female participants the islamic religion believes in gender equality when it comes to receiving knowledge if a woman rises to the fore in preaching and issuing fatwas she must be equipped with the skills to respond to religious womenrelated inquiries he said©  almonitor llc

for days the country has reported record numbers of daily deaths and hospitalizations are skyrocketing thanks in part to the spread of the highly infectious delta variant on thursday russia reported  new infections and it set a grim new record for daily deaths with  confirmed fatalities overall russia has officially identified more than  million covid cases since the pandemic beganbut despite an official ban on mass gatherings and other restrictions many russians are either ignoring or cheating on the rules videos have showed young people enjoying large partiesa fan zone set up for people to watch the euro  soccer game in st petersburg led to a massive spike in cases in neighboring finland after fans returned homerussias voluntary vaccine rollout has been painfully slow and authorities are now making it mandatory for certain workers to get shotswe see that the campaign is picking up steam and here in the last week we have three times more people getting vaccinated than before natalya kuzenkova the head doctor at clinic no  in moscow told cbs newspeople are being given the russianmade sputnik v vaccine which has been widely available since december but only  of russians have had at least a first dose thus far authorities have blamed everything from russian nihilism to the sense of freedom that developed following the collapse of the soviet union for the shortcomings of the vaccine rollout but surveys from independent pollsters show that mistrust of the government and of its approval procedure for vaccines in particular has grown so wide that a majority of russians still say they dont want to get vaccinated why would i get vaccinated one man with fairly typical views told cbs news im a healthy man and never got sick so i dont need it if i get sick then i get sick whats the difference thats my personal choicethat reluctance as well as the governments move to mandate vaccination for many people has led to a booming black market for fake vaccine certificates  one man being held by authorities for selling fake certificates said he had been delivering them since april he made hundreds of them in a tiny office that was raided as part of a sting operation by law enforcement agencies which have launched a nationwide crackdownfor about  authorities say criminals will ensure that the vials containing a clients allocated vaccine doses are simply poured out while theyre given fake certificates and are added to the official registry of vaccinated citizens allowing them access to workplaces and restaurants russian president vladimir putins own inoculation has been shrouded in secrecy but he recently claimed that he was given russias domestically produced sputnik v vaccine and hes pleaded with other russians to do the samethe only way to prevent the further spread of the epidemic is through vaccination putin said recently i hope that the prejudice among some of our citizens will recede as vaccination goes onif the government can convince more russians to get vaccinated the next problem facing the country could be widespread supply shortages last week moscow ran out of doses of two of the three approved vaccines and several other regions across the country have also reported shortagesfirst published on july     am©  cbs interactive inc all rights reservedfor breaking news  analysis download the free cbs news appcopyright

how old russia actually is the key to this question lies in a different one exactly which russia are we talking aboutthe red square in moscow in august a brief period of chaotic power struggle in the political corridors of moscow in the late s and early s resulted in the official dissolution of the ussr in russia day a public holiday celebrated annually on june  commemorating the adoption of the declaration of state sovereignty of the russian soviet federative socialist republic is oftentimes confused with the birthday of the modern postsoviet russian state however its misleading to track the existence of the modern russian state to the declaration adopted on june  although the document paved the way for the dissolution of the soviet union by establishing the priority of russian laws over the laws of the ussr the actual emergence of the modern russian state happened only a year later when the russian parliament announced the country would be called ‘russia or the ‘russian federation and the ussr officially disintegrated on december  hence the modern russian state turned  in despite a relatively recent reset of its life clock the russian statehood is actually much older than  for  years before the emergence of russia as a modern and independent state the country  albeit with a different name  was a part of the soviet union along with other states members of the communist alliancein that capacity russia existed from december   and up until the dissolution of the soviet union in  and before the soviet union was fully and officially formed russia existed in the form of the russian soviet federative socialist republic rsfsr which was not yet a part of the ussr in that capacity russian statehood has existed since adding the number of years russia existed as the rsfsr within and outside of the ussr with the number of years russia existed as a modern independent state makes russia  years old in grand duke of moscow ivan iiithe often romanticized time of the russian empire ended with the revolution in  but it had been around for quite some time its known that peter the great proclaimed the emergence of the russian empire  and himself as its emperor  in but even before that the russian state existed in a different form as the tsardom of russia was formed under the rule of ivan the terrible in this is not to mention the formation of the grand duchy of moscow in  ivan iii who ruled this political entity from  assumed the title of the grand prince of all rusadd this into the equation and russia turned  in reproduction of the painting grandchildren of gostomysl rurik truvor sineus by artist ilya glazunovofficially however it is agreed to trace the emergence of russian statehood as far back as to the th century back then  according to the primary chronicle  varangian prince rurik was called upon by the finnic and eastern slavic peoples of the northwestern lands to rule over them he settled in novgorod in  and thus launched the first official russian statehoodobviously for rurik to be summoned there must have been people who would have sent for him and his entourage to show up people had lived on these lands before the rurikids dynasty was established however it is universally accepted to trace back the emergence of the russian statehood to  nonethelessso the next time someone asks you how old russia is you now know it turns  in  or

troops in central asia near afghanistan russia warns us against deploying troops in central asia near afghanistan moscow ap  russia has strongly warned the united states against deploying its troops in the former soviet central asian nations following their withdrawal from afghanistan a senior diplomat said in remarks published on tuesday russias deputy foreign minister sergei ryabkov said that moscow conveyed the message to washington during russian president vladimir putins summit with us president joe biden in geneva last month the warning comes as the us military said last week that  percent of the withdrawal of us troops and equipment from afghanistan is complete biden said the us military mission in afghanistan will conclude on aug  i would emphasize that the redeployment of the american permanent military presence to the countries neighboring afghanistan is unacceptable ryabkov said we told the americans in a direct and straightforward way that it would change a lot of things not only in our perceptions of whats going on in that important region but also in our relations with the united states he added that russia has also issued the warning to central asian nations we cautioned them against such steps and we also have had a frank talk on the subject with our central asian allies neighbors and friends and also other countries in the region that would be directly affected ryabkov said in an interview published in the mezhdunarodnaya zhizn magazine on monday russian foreign minister sergey lavrov emphasized that kazakhstan kyrgyzstan and tajikistan are all members of the collective security treaty organization and any presence of foreign troops on their territories must be endorsed by the security pact he added that none of those countries have raised the issue tajikistan and kyrgyzstan both host russian military bases kyrgyzstan which hosted a us military base that supported operations in afghanistan closed it in get the militarys most

defense ministry reaffirmed in may that the countrys constitution and its military doctrine rule out the presence of any foreign troops on its territory i dont think that the emergence of new american military facilities in central asia would promote security in the region lavrov said the biden administration has reportedly considered uzbekistan and tajikistan that border afghanistan as well as kazakhstan as possible staging areas for monitoring and quickly responding to possible security problems that may follow the us militarys withdrawal from afghanistan i dont think that anyone is interested in becoming a hostage to such us policy and intentions and in inviting retaliation lavrov said the russian foreign minister questioned what results would be achieved with a small us presence outside afghanistan when a strong nato force inside the country failed to do anything most probably they simply want to ensure their military presence in central asia and be able to influence the situation in this region as the american and nato troops were swiftly pulling out the taliban have made quick gains across the country they claimed on friday that they now control  of afghanistans territory russian officials have expressed concern that the taliban surge could destabilize central asia taliban advances already have forced hundreds of afghan soldiers to flee across the border into tajikistan which called up  military reservists to strengthen its southern border with afghanistan last week a senior taliban delegation visited moscow to offer assurances that the insurgents advances in afghanistan do not threaten russia or its allies in central asia russian disinformation targets vaccines and the biden administration  the new york times advertisementsupported byrussian disinformation targets vaccines and the biden administrationa new campaign appears to be spreading falsehoods about the potential for forced inoculations against covidby julian e barnesthe cartoon posted on the farright discussion forum showed police officers wearing bidenharris campaign logos on bulletproof vests and battering down a door with a large syringe a caption read in part in bidens americathe cartoon appears to be an example of the latest effort in russianaligned disinformation a campaign that taps into skepticism and fears of coronavirus vaccination to not just undermine the effort to immunize people but also try to falsely link the bidenharris administration to the idea of forced inoculations the image was one of several spotted by graphika a company tracking disinformation campaignsboth russia and china have worked to promote their own vaccines through messaging that undermines american and european vaccination programs according to the state departments global engagement center but in addition to overt messaging promoting their own vaccines moscow has also spread conspiracy theories last year the department began warning about how russia was using fringe websites to promote doubts around vaccinationsit is difficult to quantify the amount of disinformation being produced at any time by the russians or other adversarial powers government officials and outside experts said but the rise of the delta variant of the coronavirus  and shifting scientific advice on how to defend against a more infectious strain and the need for booster shots or masks  has created an atmosphere for misinformation to more easily spread experts saiddisinformation thrives in an information vacuum said lisa kaplan the chief executive of the alethea group which helps corporations guard against misinformation that is when disinformation can really take hold and knowing how the russians typically play those situations it wouldnt surprise me they are trying to take advantage of itthe aim of various russian groups continues to be to exacerbate tensions in western societies a key foreign policy goal of moscow according to american officials briefed on the disinformation effortsthe russian and chinese disinformation has tried to magnify the potential side effects of the pfizer and moderna vaccines suggesting that the mrna technology they are based on is untested or risky state department officials said this weekin recent weeks the nature of russian disinformation has also begun to shift some officials and outside experts said recent postings spreading false information have suggested that the biden administration is intent on mandating that americans get vaccines that are failing against the coronavirusthe campaign also comes as president biden warned president vladimir v putin of russia last month to rein in ransomware attacks emanating out of russia and aimed at critical american infrastructure though the ransomware attacks are separate from the disinformation campaigns the warning was the latest effort by united states officials to prod russia to rein in destructive digital incursionsthe biden administration is actively monitoring russian misinformation and is trying to counter it by encouraging the public to get vaccinated and promoting the safety and efficacy of western vaccines according to an administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss potentially sensitive informationwhile some of the messaging posted on social media from russian statemedia accounts aims at a potentially wide audience some of the most audacious disinformation postings have been aimed at much smaller farright audiencesgraphika has tracked disinformation that is probably spread by a group affiliated with people who used to work with the st petersburgbased internet research agency which propagated disinformation during the  election the group has posted cartoons on patriotswin a message board featuring farright politicsa recent spate of antivaccination cartoons appears to have been spread by the same people involved in a fake media outlet linked to veterans of the internet research agency said jack stubbs graphikas director of investigationwhile the group advances moscows strategic narratives it is unclear what precise ties if any it has to the russian governmentin another cartoon that appears to be the work of the organization a group of people that the caption suggests might be texas democratic legislators reached toward vice president kamala harris in a menacing waywe just looking for some democracy says one in the groupcough dont worry we took pfizer shots says anotherto hell with your pfizer shots the cartoon figure of ms harris responds i dont want to get sickthe title of the cartoon on the farright discussion forum suggested the texas democrats had given ms harris the virus even though she had been vaccinated the texans had gone to washington last month in an attempt to block voting legislation that they said would disenfranchise minority groups while in the capital the group met with ms harris and several tested positive for the coronavirus but there is no evidence the vice president became illthe grammatical errors in the cartoon according to graphika are similar to those sometimes made by native russian speakers writing in english and the technique of targeting audiences with inflammatory messages around existing social tensions and rifts has long been a hallmark of groups linked to the internet research agencythats exactly again what they appear to be doing around covid mr stubbs said rather than promote the russian vaccine or denigrate a western vaccine theyre using this as an opportunity to criticize biden primarily and say the biden administration has been failing and they havent been managing the pandemic properlytheir use of farright message boards including patriotswin was earlier reported by graphika and reutersmuch of the disinformation efforts are posted on websites with little to no moderation patriotswin which bills itself as a forum supportive of donald j trump began on reddit before it was kicked off from patriotswin some of the material attributed to foreign disinformation campaigns have migrated to larger sites with rightwing audiences like gab and parlerthe moderators of patriotswin responded to a request for comment with an antigay slur and suggested perhaps facetiously that chinese organizations were posting material but routing it through russia to fool journalistsmeasuring the impact of the disinformation efforts is difficult given the deep divisions over vaccinations that already exist in the united states and europe exploiting splits among americans is a typical russian tactic even on the hardright discussion forums some users have fingered the cartoons as being russian in origin though the postings have continuedbut the russian messaging has shifted not just on the farright sites similarly the alliance for securing democracy a nonprofit group focused on disinformation has tracked a change in what the russian staterun media has been producingearlier forums like rt a kremlinbacked englishlanguage site were focused on promoting russias vaccine and denigrating western vaccines but more recently russias staterun media has been really leaning into the culture war debates over vaccine and mask mandates said bret schafer a disinformation expert at the alliance for securing democracyrussia uses rt and other statecontrolled media to amplify american and international skeptics of vaccines and mask mandates according to an american officialrt has published articles highlighting athletes who are resisting pressure to get vaccinated it has also suggested liberals were taking at face value donald trump jrs facetious remark that vaccinations could be required to vote and it has published essays aimed at exacerbating divisions over mask requirementsthe efforts are not just targeting americans mr shafer said rts germanlanguage youtube feed has focused on public resistance to vaccines theyre hitting the same notes he said with most of their western propaganda outletssheryl gay stolberg contributed reportingadvertisement  forbidden opinion  trying to pry russia away from china is a fools errand  the washington post opinion trying to pry russia away from china is a fools errandpresident biden has rightly made competing with china his top foreign policy priority in its first major policy document the biden administration stated that china is the only competitor potentially capable of combining its economic diplomatic military and technological power to mount a challenge to a stable and open international system in his address to a joint session of congress biden said were in competition with china and other countries to win the st century with biden in attendance a nato summit communique stated for the first time that the rise of china has security implications for all allies so for this administration and many more to come formulating effective strategies for addressing chinas rise will remain the focal point of us foreign policy not unlike the central role that the soviet union played for us strategists during the cold warcertain lessons from the cold war therefore are worth studying and repeating for dealing with china today others are not one successful cold war play not worth running again is trying to peel russia away from chinaabstractly the idea of pulling russia toward the united states to balance against china sounds appealing its classic realpolitik logic along these lines daniel yergin recently praised us flexibility on sanctions toward the germanrussian nord stream  pipeline as a possible olive branch that would encourage russia to distance itself from china in what is described as a priority strategy for this administrationyergins outlook gives voice to a sentiment many selfdescribed realists  sometimes publicly often privately  express because president richard m nixon succeeded in moving the peoples republic of china away from the soviet union during the cold war biden should today attempt to pull russia toward the united states and away from china conveying this strategy most comprehensively an anonymous government official recently argued the united states must rebalance its relationship with russia whether it likes it or not    it is in the united states enduring interest to prevent further deepening of the moscowbeijing ententethe current sinorussian partnership is worrying and the impulse to view all other foreign policy issues through the uschina bilateral lens is tempting but this particular cold war play wont work today  and even if it did it would not yield the same benefits that it produced last centuryadvocates of the nixongoestochina strategy forget the essential precondition for its success the sinosoviet split following a honeymoon after mao zedong seized power in  the two communist regimes soon manifested a serious doctrinal divergence which accelerated after joseph stalins death and what beijing labeled as nikita khrushchevs revisionist ways in  the two countries even fought a short border war by the time national security adviser henry kissinger made his first secret visit to beijing in  he did not need to convince premier zhou enlai to distance china from moscow that divorce had occurred long beforeby contrast chineserussian economic security and ideological ties today are closer than ever vladimir putin frames international politics in ideological terms autocrats versus democrats he sees xi jinping as his most important ideological partner while xi in turn has called putin his best friend so why would putin abandon his autocratic soul mate to flirt with a democratic leader hes met only twice moreover the united states is a democracy giving other actors  especially congress  a say in foreign policy decisionmaking particularly regarding human rights in putins view xi is a powerful more reliable partner  in ways that biden and his successors can never beeven if such a policy shift succeeded rapprochement with putins russia would bring few benefits and many disadvantages what concretely could the united states gain in its competition with china by having russia on our side the answer is not much china needs russias energy exports while the united states does not beyond whats in place now putin will never deploy additional russian soldiers missiles or ships to contain china in asia maybe putin could help isolate xi at the un security council and other international forums but ultimately beijing has its own vetosecond in return for pivoting putin would demand unsavory concessions especially regarding ukraine and georgia thats a bad trade a return to sphereofinfluence geopolitics  proputin pundits sometimes call it yalta   hurts the longterm interests of the united states and our european alliesmost detrimentally closer relations with a russian autocrat to help contain a chinese autocrat will undermine bidens aspiration to unite the free world about which he has spoken so passionately in the last six months bidens professed global goals to fight corruption and support democracy would look hypocritical if he even toyed with rapprochement with a corrupt dictator in moscow some of the united states most embarrassing and costly mistakes during the cold war came from its toleration  and in some cases its outright embrace  of strongmen generals theocrats and apartheid in the name of containing the soviet unionsomeday the united states should seek deeper partnership with russia in containing and competing with china but that policy should be initiated with a democratic russia not

vaccine was approved                      sputnikv was the first vaccine in the world to be greenlit yet under  of russians are fully vaccinated          ulyana was in the middle of a haircut when it happened sitting inside a st petersburg beauty salon she was chatting with other customers when the topic of vaccines came up one women declared that she refused to be the russian governments lab rat and the other women murmured in agreement ulyana then told her hairdresser katya that shed gotten the sputnikv vaccine and felt finekatya was shocked the hairdresser got out her scissors and slowly moved them toward ulyanas shoulders she believed ulyana had a microchip in her shoulderi was speechless said ulyana a yearold consultant she explained to me that in the videos she had seen on the internet vaccinated people could stick metal objects like coins to their bodies in the place of injection because the vaccine chip draws themthe hairdresser showed ulyana the instagram video shed seen as well as a telegram group she subscribed to the groups members numbering in the thousands spoke of how the government would be able to use the vaccine to implant a microchip that would give it the power to control someone like a video game characteri have known katya for a while and she is a nice girl ulyana said i have always imagined people who might believe in all those conspiracy theories are weirdos in tinfoil hats she is a normal person a working mom with a kidrussia has a dreadful vaccine hesitancy problem its sputnikv vaccine was authorized a year ago in august  and deployed in december but nine months later just  of russians are estimated to be fully vaccinated the more transmissible delta variant is proving ruinous in the face of such limited defenses case numbers are going up and unlike in the more vaccinated us and uk deaths are shooting up too the country recorded  deaths on wednesday aug  an alltime highthe official statistics say  russians have died from covid but with excess deaths standing at  since the pandemic began experts analyzing excess mortality data estimate the true death toll could be triple the official count that vladimir putins administration cant be counted on to provide legitimate covid numbers is part of the problem after years of the government sowing disinformation many russians dont trust the kremlin when it tells them to get vaccinated with so many seeds of distrust planted conspiracy theories flourishwhen ulyana was accused by her hairdresser of having a chip in her shoulder she laughed it off she tried to tell katya that the videos were fake katya rejected the argument  instead reasoning that they switched the chips off after being exposed by the viral videosrussian president vladimir putin announced last august via a zoomlike teleconference broadcast on state tv that sputnikv had been authorized for deploymentwhen sputnikv was made available to the russian public in december authorities hoped  of adults would be vaccinated by july the failure to reach this milestone doesnt reflect lethargy among russians in fact many russians have proved remarkably energetic  in their efforts to avoid vaccinationthe country is home to a thriving black market for vaccination certificates which are required for many hospitality retail and transport employees to return to work state tv last month warned of a growing trend evidently spawned by a viral tiktokvideo that sees russians eluding the jab by getting the injection in a prosthetic limbcovid denialism and vaccine skepticism exist everywhere but russia has a unique problem much of the population harbors a specific distrust of the russianmade sputnikv vaccinesputnikv has a horrible reputation in the country said andrei soldatov an author and senior fellow at the center for european policy analysis a nonprofit public policy group everybody hates itsputnikv was developed with exceptional speed at moscows gamaleya research institute of epidemiology and microbiology russian scientists had a prototype vaccine in march  before the city even went into lockdown around a month before the trump administration accelerated us vaccine production with operation warp speed it was august  when the sptunikv was approved with putin assuring the public that the vaccine had gone through all the necessary checksmany russians became convinced that authorization of sputnikv had more to do with russia clearing a vaccine before the us than anything else this is implied by the name sputnik is a reference to the satellite the soviets launched into space embarrassing the us in the early cold war years while the v is for victory this perception became stronger when putin was found to be speaking dishonestly at the time he said sputnikv had been clinically verified phase iii trials which test the safety and efficacy of a vaccine against a placebo had yet to even beginthat reputation has stuck even a year after sputnikv was authorized according to ekaterina borozdina an associate professor in sociology at the european university in st petersburg whos been surveying educated professionals about vaccine hesitancyrespondents were concerned that vaccination campaigns are designed to reach some statelevel goals including purely political goals related to a kind of competition with other countries she said via email adding that respondents often felt that any health risks associated with taking a vaccine arent as important to bureaucrats as ratcheting up vaccination statisticsthe kremlins apparent obsession with vaccine supremacy may have undermined the credibility of what appears to be a legitimate vaccine sputnikv is used not just in russia but also in countries like argentina hungary and india and the phase iii data published in the lancet medical journal shows a  efficacy in blocking transmission phase iii trials took place prior to the delta variants spreadits rapid development can be chalked up to the gamaleya institutes expediency it began working away at a vaccine as soon as scientists released the genome sequence for the coronavirus in january  and it used as a foundation the work it had already done to craft vaccines for the ebola virus and the mers coronavirusif you have the vaccine platform well established then it is an easy matter to go from mers to covid explained nikolai petrovsky a vaccine researcher and vice president of the international immunomics society the published data suggest that sputnikv is a reasonable vaccine very similar to astrazeneca and johnson  johnson adenovirus vaccinesbut while it might be a good vaccine people have a right to be skeptical given the absence of reliable dataeven after it was deployed for widespread use in december putin hurt public perception of sputnik by avoiding vaccination until march unusually for a president renowned for ostentatious photo ops the kremlin sent out no video or photo of the event he didnt even say which vaccine he received  not until two months later after much questioning did he reveal it was sputnikva vaccination center in st petersburgwhen russia was found to have systematically doped its olympic athletes in the runup to s sochi games the sports minister offered an apology later that year he was promoted to deputy prime minister ulyana thinks that wellknown misdeeds like this hurt the russian governments credibility which matters when that same government is beseeching citizens to roll up their sleeves for a vaccineit naturally creates a lot of mistrust in the society when people see that our officials face no real consequences even after being called out for their actions by the international community she saidthough sputnikv supplies have been lacking in parts of russia trust appears to be the resource its government needs most to battle covid the countrys population trusts its business media and government institutions less than any other countrys population polled by edelman for the firms annual trust barometer tellingly just  of russians surveyed last october and november for the  trust barometer said theyd get a covid vaccination as soon as possible compared with  of americans  of brazilians and  of indiansconspiracy theories have unsurprisingly proliferated in such an atmosphere of mistrust among those theories is the belief shared by  of russians that covid was created in a lab as a biological weapon the conspiracy theory that billionaires like bill gates are using the vaccine to reduce the global population to  billion is also popular as is the theory that claims face masks contain infectious nanowormsthe kremlin may have inadvertently fueled conspiracy theories about sputnikv as it relentlessly spun disinformation about foreign vaccines which are banned in the country facebook has pulled over  russialinked accounts that were spreading vaccine misinformation state tv regularly amplifies any misfortunes that befall the small percentage of pfizer and moderna recipients who experience side effects and one of russias most famous tv pundits last year denounced astrazeneca as a monkey vaccine because oxford built the vaccine off a variant of covid that infects chimpanzees the result may be greater skepticism of vaccines in general not just western onesfaced with such ardent suspicion the kremlin at first tried to win over russians with a sweet deal governments offered mobile vaccinations free ice creamor even free money in exchange for vaccinations now with the delta variant running rampant the kremlin is making vaccination mandatory for publicfacing workers like hospitality and retail employees as of late june muscovites need to be vaccinated to enter restaurantsthe strategy is turning russian politics on its head with putins usual critics becoming supporters of the kremlins vaccine drivethe most liberal part of the society which is usually more critical of the government they are pushing for more government control in terms of restrictions said soldatov of cepa the rest of the population which usually is more in favor of the government they are getting more suspicious of the vaccineseeking solutions putins administration may be looking to introduce more vaccine variety into the country last week it approved trials to see how the astrazeneca vaccine works in tandem with sputnikv indicating it may break its moratorium on international vaccinesfor ulyana however the solution isnt more vaccines its more honestyi wish the authorities could at least acknowledge some of their past mistakes and start an honest dialogue about the issue she said its really critical the death rates are the highest since the beginning of the pandemicshes tired of arguing with vaccine deniers she says especially when you simply want to get a haircut emissions from russian permafrost could spike tenfold if leaders ignore un climate report warning  the moscow times emissions from russian permafrost could spike tenfold if leaders ignore un climate report warningrussias permafrost could deteriorate fast and spark an accelerating loop of warming if world leaders dont heed un climate scientists call to drastically cut global carbon emissions an expert told the moscow timesthe intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc report published monday shows unequivocally that climate change is progressing more quickly than feared  with temperatures already  degree celsius above preindustrial levels  and that time is running out to prevent catastrophic warming it expands upon the ipccs  climate assessment which came two years before nearly  countries signed the paris climate agreement in hopes of keeping warming below  cthis ipcc report studies climate feedback effects in much more detail than the previous report the world wildlife foundation wwf russias head of climate and energy research alexei kokorin saidlarge amounts of carbon are stored within permafrost the layer of soil that stays frozen yearround and covers nearly  percent of russias territorywhile this permafrost doesnt currently emit much carbon \\u200b\\u200bkokorin said its emissions could increase tenfold by  if global greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise at their current paceexperts believe that as permafrost melts it will release an increasing amount of carbon leading to warming that in turn melts even more permafrost  setting off a cycle of warming nearly impossible to stopkokorin also said russia can expect to see extreme weather events with increasing frequency with onceinadecade heat waves happening every five years if global temperatures rise  c beyond preindustrial levels and happening nearly every year if the planet warms by  cthat could affect whether people will choose to live in moscow if a heatwave like the current one happens every five years you can see it as bearable but what if it happens almost every year would we have to move the russian capital to another location kokorin saidmore detailed information will be available when russias national climate assessment comes out sometime next year kokorin saidwhile the ipcc report relied mostly on scientific

coincide with the opening of one the city‘s most prestigious annual events the st petersburg international economic forumthe forum a gathering of russias elite and a showcase for its biggest companies has become a flagship event under president vladimir putin over five days  people were expected to attend the event where putin told the audience that life was gradually returning to its normal

last bulletin before the numbers vanished had shown st petersburg hospitalizing  people a day  a record number and one that meant the city would run out of hospital beds within daysjournalists and critics of the government quickly started asking if the disappearance of the covid statistics was connected to holding the forum st petersburgs administration refused to comment and the latest figures

st petersburgs city assembly who also opposed holding the forum they dont care about peoples lives and healththroughout the pandemic russian authorities have been accused of massaging statistics to hide the real scale of the countrys covid impact the kremlin has repeatedly suggested that although it has been difficult russia has fared better than most other countries even as it has neglected to impose tough lockdown measuresbut publicly available mortality statistics as well as other data show an ever growing yawning gap between russias official covid figures and what are likely the far larger real numbers the data suggest the true death toll may already be over a halfmillion people far from doing better than most the data suggests that in reality russia has suffered one of the deadliest covid epidemics in the worldthe toll is growing even steeper now as russia endures a deadly third wave that has remained largely unchecked amid few restrictions and poor vaccination uptake  the latter caused in part by some of the highest levels of vaccine scepticism in the worldrussias official covid death toll published by the governments coronavirus task force currently stands at around  in total numbers that still places russia fourth in the world behind only brazil india and the united states but given the size of the countrys  million population and the number of cases it has had that number appears puzzlingly lowthere is a consensus among experts internationally that the best method to assess the true toll of the pandemic in russia is by counting socalled excess deaths that is comparing the total number of deaths from any cause in a country during the pandemic periods with the total number of deaths in an average yearalmost every country hit by the pandemic has seen a steep increase in total deaths compared to the average although some of those extra deaths can be attributed to other causes such as disruption to health systems most experts believe the vast majority are covid deathsrussias official death toll doesnt take into account excess deaths but its national statistics service rosstat has quietly continued to release total mortality data for each month publishing it in spreadsheets on its website that has allowed independent demographers and journalists to calculate excess deaths for russia during the pandemicthe mortality data so far released by rosstat shows that in  russia suffered  more deaths than in  for the first five months of  there were  more excess deathsthat means russia has sustained at least  more deaths during the pandemic than usual already three times higher than its officially reported toll that does not yet include june and july the deadliest months of the current third wavei think that by the end of september the overall excess mortality will be at least  people said alexey raksha an independent demographer who previously worked at rosstat it is a huge numberby proportion of the population the current figures give russia the highest death toll of any major country in the world and place it in the top five of any country in the world behind only peru bulgaria north macedonia and serbia according to a ranking by the economist tracking excess deaths globallyin november and december of last year the number of deaths have been record the biggest in history in postwar history in russia said raksharaksha was fired from his job as a demographer at rosstat last year after he publicly pointed out the discrepancies in the official covid statistics he has accused russian authorities of crudely manipulating the numbers which he says is visible in the unnatural anomalies in the data released by the countrys coronavirus task forcehe points to line graphs showing monthly deaths for moscow where steep curves indicating increasing deaths at certain times suddenly flatline and hold steady for several daysits in contradiction with all statistical epidemiological demographical law raksha said its just impossiblehe said the sudden plateaus are nicknamed the soybanins shelf referring to moscows mayor sergey sobyanin he said they were the result of city officials simply putting a limit on the number of deaths that could be published that dayat some point sobyanin just ordered not to show more than  deaths daily in moscow thats it raksha saidrussian health officials have previously said they take a more conservative approach to assessing covid deaths but that does not explain the vast difference and at times officials have acknowledged the real death toll is substantially higherin december deputy prime minister tatiana golikova who oversees the covid response acknowledged that around  of all excess deaths in russia were caused by covid the federal statistics service in june also published an estimate suggesting there had been over  covid deathsbut russias primary official death toll which is most often used internationally and in state media has not been updated to match those statementsa  recent investigation by three independent russian investigative news sites also found evidence that internal government records show it is also concealing the scale of covid cases in the country by as much as five timesthe sites meduza kholod and mediazona reported that an oversight by russias health ministry in issuing certificates confirming recent covid patients had inadvertently revealed the ministry has a database containing  million recorded covid cases the official public count currently only shows six millionthe government has denied the reports but issued conflicting responses saying the database was not accurate and that it also contained vaccination numberscritics have said the efforts to make russias bout with the pandemic appear less deadly are making it worse by discouraging people from taking the virus seriously which they say also hampers its push to vaccinate although russias sputnik v vaccine has been found to be effective authorities are struggling to persuade russians to get itwith few restrictions in place and still less than  of the population fully vaccinated doctors in the city told abc news they feared a fourth wave in the autumn was already inevitabledoctors will answer for it not the government said a paramedic in st petersburg who requested anonymity over concerns she could face retaliationin st petersburg last week alexander yablokov a yearold soccer manager said he did not believe the official death toll after he spent three weeks in a covid hospital while there he said he was in a small ward where all but one of seven patients with him died within a week he said he had pulled his blanket over his head whenever he heard the sound of a gurney coming down the corridor

investigative media outlet was outlawed in an act of revenge for a series of deeply embarrassing revelations about vladimir putin and top kremlin officialsthe rare decision to ban a critical media outlet by fiat is a bellwether for russias new wave of investigative news outlets which compete to publish damaging scoops about top officials and are now bracing for the kremlin to employ similar pressure on them to shut downstate media on thursday announced that russias justice ministry had added proekt to a list of undesirable organisations meaning its journalists must stop working for the site or face criminal prosecution and added eight journalists including proekts editorinchief roman badanin to a register of foreign agents several reporters for radio free europeradio liberty and the russian news outlet open media were also declared foreign agentsit is illegal for other news agencies to link to or directly quote materials from an undesirable organisation meaning theoretically they would have to purge their archives of any reference to proekts work or possibly face criminal charges the status would also outlaw any efforts by proekt to crowdfund their donors could also face chargesthe assault on proekt on critical and independent media in russia has seen news websites like meduza and vtimes declared foreign agents the latter has since shut down journalists from the student journal doxa put on trial the investigative arm of alexei navalnys anticorruption fund declared extremist and millions sought in fines against the usfunded rferlbut it is the first time that a news outlet has explicitly been banned under the law the closest example is the closure of the media arm of mikhail khodorkovskys open russia and appears to indicate how proekt touched a nerve in the kremlin by investigating top officials and sensitive subjects like russias bungled covid response and its deployment of mercenaries to africalast week badanin and two other employees of proekt were targeted with house searches by police who said they were investigating a fouryearold slander case but proekts employees tied the searches to their plans to release a damning investigation into the interior minister vladimir kolokoltsev which alleged that his family members had become fabulously rich since his appointment in  and that he was suspected of having ties to organised crimeproekt has also published investigations into some of putins most feared associates including chechnya head ramzan kadyrov and the businessman yevgeny prigozhin using leaked property and passport information the website also contended in an article last year that putin had a daughter by a secret mistressfor years kremlinfriendly businessmen had bought out or reined in critical outlets warning journalists not to cross the double lines or be firedbut the emergence of new investigative outlets like proekt which reduced their footprint in russia to avoid government pressure has left the government with fewer tools to control their output besides declaring them foreign agents bankrupting them or seeking other ways to close them downproekt did not immediately comment on the government decision on thursday

from competing in international sporting events until next year for running a statesponsored doping program and yet there are  russian gymnasts sprinters and other athletes competing openly in tokyowith them is a small army of coaches assistants and others who have not been shy about cheering their team on even though the japanese  before they declared a state of emergency and banned all fans from the stands  explicitly forbade cheering for fear it could spread covidin fact as of wednesday the russian athletes had won  medals putting them in third place after china and the united states according to the latest olympic medals tallythat they are able to continue adding to moscows medal haul despite not being an official russian team is due to an enormous loophole that enables them to compete as members of a madeup entity called roc which stands for the russian olympic committeeand that infuriates critics who say the russians have got a slap on the wrist from an international olympic committee that is too afraid to administer a punishment that fits their crimeback in the days of east germany they doped their athletes in every sport except sailing then known as yachting david wallechinsky former president of the international society of olympic historians told nbc news the russians went beyond that they doped sailors and curlers of all thingsit was so extensive it was outrageous he said when the story came out it was an enormous scandal and i personally felt that they just should have banned russia from the olympics for four years – periodinstead the ioc imposed a penalty that was so weak and wimpy that it was painfulnow you have a situation right here right now where the russians feel you know ‘ok we got away with it yeah some of our athletes went down but we got a bunch more wallechinsky said and frankly we could do it again and sacrifice more athletestravis tygart chief executive of the us antidoping agency called the ioc penalties on the russians a farceunfortunately weve seen this horror film already – where the russian statesponsored doping program walks free and russia wins while the ioc and wada leaders attempt to pull the wool over the worlds eyes by claiming russia is banned tygart said referring to the world antidoping agency in an email to reuters that was published saturday it is barely a rebrand and will do nothing to stop the corruption in russia and likely will embolden others willing to win by any meansnbc news has reached out to roc spokesman konstantin vybornov so far there has been no replythe ioc responded with a statement that did not address whether the russians were being allowed to escape serious punishment and insisted the fight against doping and the protection of clean athletes are top priorities for the iocioc spokesman mark adams has already been on the receiving end of questions from reporters about why the roc athletes are routinely being referred to as russians by olympic officials theyre not supposed to be and whether the ioc will take steps to derussify the references to the roc ahead of the beijing winter olympics in februaryroc athletes will be competing there because the ban on russia is until dec  in certain circumstances we can say ‘russia olympic committee adams insisted during a press conference last weekrussia was officially banned in  from competing

and their national anthem isnt played during medal ceremoniesthe opening bars of tchaikovskys piano concerto no  have been played the dozen times a russian has won a gold medal at these games and the flag theyve waved is not the russian flag but it has an olympic flame in russias white blue and red colors with the olympic rings beneath themthe roc athletes are not allowed to have the word russia emblazoned on their uniforms unless its accompanied by the words neutral athleteand thats about itwallechinsky said there is a reason why russia is being treated with kid gloves by the iocthe ioc just took the position i believe that there are certain countries that are just too important to the olympic movement to eliminate russia being one of them the united states being one china being another my guess some of the western european nations would also qualify he saidtygart insisted he was not painting all the roc athletes with a broad brushof course it is not fair to call into question any individual athletes performance and all are presumed innocent unless and until proven otherwise he saidbut the circumstances under which the roc athletes are competing have raised suspicions among some competitorsafter the us swimmer ryan murphy finished second to the roc swimmer evgeny rylov in the meter backstroke friday he said its a huge mental drain on me  that im swimming in a race thats probably not cleanit frustrates me but i have to swim the field thats next to me he saidmurphy did not name names and rylov who was sitting next to him during the press conference tried to paper the remark overi have always been for clean competition he said from the bottom of my heart i am for clean sport ive devoted my entire life to this sport ryan didnt accuse me of anything so id rather not

comes just a month after a court in moscow outlawed navalnys political infrastructure  his foundation for fighting corruption and a network of regional offices  as extremist in a ruling that prevents people associated with the groups from seeking public office and exposes them to lengthy prison terms navalny putins fiercest political foe was arrested in january upon returning from germany where he spent five months recovering from a nerve agent poisoning that he blames on the kremlin  an accusation rejected by russian officials in february the politician was ordered to serve ½ years in prison

arrests by russian security forces and in some places alleged torture across russia hundreds have been charged as extremists and dozens have been jailed in a campaign that human rights groups have struggled to explainbanned under the soviet union and authorized in the liberal years following its collapse the renewed persecution of jehovahs witnesses is seen by some as the frightening return of soviet oppression once thought gone as well as a reflection of how security services under president vladimir putin are turning the clock back on dissentwe are talking about a group of people who are practicing their religion peacefully who are not carrying out any violent actions who are not interfering with public order said tanya lokshina the human rights watch associate director for europe and central asiaand those people are treated as dangerous criminals as quote unquote extremistsreminds me of the inquisitionthe jehovahs witnesses were banned under an antiextremism law nominally intended for dangerous violent organizations it means that the peaceful group which has no history of violence and forbids involvement in politics was placed alongside terrorist organizations such as isis or the japanese doomsday cult aum shinrikyo which carried a nerve agent attack on the tokyo subway in people charged with participating in the jehovahs witnesses can be sentenced up to six years in a prison camp and organizers can face up to  years in many cases just praying in a group has been enough for police to bring charges against a personsince  police have carried out hundreds of raids on jehovahs witnesses homes and meeting places all across russia according to the religious group as well as human rights groups over  adherents have been charged under the extremism law and dozens are already jailed on sentences up to eight yearsdozens of those charged are elderly  some as old as  in the far eastern city of vladivostok an  yearold was charged with extremism and placed on a terrorism watchlistit reminds me of the inquisition said evgeny kandaurov a journalist and jehovahs witness whose home was raided earlier this yearthe extremist designation also means that when police conduct raids on jehovahs witnesses they act as though they are storming hideouts of armed terroristsdozens of videos released by law enforcement show officers in full body armor and helmets often armed with guns and batons entering the apartments of terrified people in some cases police rip down doors with power saws and crow barsthe show of force is directed against people usually sitting quietly in prayer or otherwise defenseless asleep in their pajamas officers often appear aware theres no threat sometimes just ringing the door bell and waiting while standing in their combat gearofficers act as if some very dangerous criminal activity were actually going on lokshina said while in fact what theyre dealing with is people who are praying and talking and peacefully practicing their faith i thought i was going to suffocate to deathin its first years the enforcement campaign mostly took place in regions far outside moscowone morning in february  in the northern city of surgut about  miles from moscow law enforcement officers rounded up around  jehovahs witnesses according to the churchthe believers were brought for interrogation at the local branch of russias investigative committee which handles serious crimes there at least seven detained men said officers tortured them including with electric shocks beatings and suffocationthey tied my hands and legs with tape one of the men sergey volosnikov  told abc news in an interview last yearthey put a bag over my head and put me on the floor then they started to close the bag so that air couldnt get in i was already preparing myself that im going to  to suffocate to death he saidvolosnikov said police then tortured him with a stun gun before demanding he sign a confessionthe other men described similar torture telling abc news they were taken into the room one by one after refusing to confess to extremism charges some of the men said the officers threatened to rape them pulling down their underwear and using a stun gun on their buttocks others said police injected them with a liquid and told them it would cause their hearts to stopi was lying on the floor all tied up with the sack on my head and they started to discuss some kind of object right which they would rape me with said artyom kim who said he was taken into the room three times where he was also electrocuted and suffocatedi was afraid for my life i was already saying goodbye to all my relatives he saidthe seven men have demanded russian federal law enforcement investigate their allegations of torture but their requests have been repeatedly rejected they saidyou cant take faith from someone if he believes it means he believes volosnikov said to beat the faith out of someone thats already totalitarianismthe kremlin has largely refused to comment on the campaign against the jehovahs witnesses when previously asked by reporters about it spokesperson dmitry peskov said the group is banned and that there is nothing more to discussin surgut nearly two dozen jehovahs witnesses remain under criminal investigation and will likely face a trial on the extremism chargestimofey zhukov a local lawyer in surgut and a jehovahs witness has helped coordinate the defense of those charged but police have put him under investigation as wellin february  abc news attended a court hearing that zhukov and around  jehovahs witnesses were at to support another believer facing chargesbefore it started two plainclothes police officers entered and approached zhukov informing him they were there to take him to a psychiatric hospital located nearly  miles awaya court had earlier ordered zhukov to undergo psychological evaluation at the hospital something he said he believed was intended to pressure him for fighting the criminal chargeshe refused to go with the two officers on the basis that the court order was under appeal after a tense standoff the two officers backed down and leftits one of their methods of repression zhukov said if there hadnt been cameras and so many people here the conversation would have ended differentlybut as zhukov exited the court building later the officers jumped him trying to drag him away from the crowd of other jehovahs witnesseszhukov managed to escape but a day later was grabbed again by police he said he spent three weeks in a psychiatric hospital housed with other men in a room with barred windows his detention echoes a practice from soviet times when authorities incarcerated dissidents in mental institutionsall this is happening just because i read the bible and am a person of faith zhukov saidnobody knows whybesides its extravagant displays of force and harsh sentences the campaign has another unusual feature no one really knows why it is happeningnobody knows lokshina said a lot of people have been trying to figure it out but nobody really knowsunlike efforts to outlaw political opponents of the kremlin there is no obvious motive for why russian authorities have targeted jehovahs witnessesinternationally the group is best known for their proselytising on door steps they share similar beliefs with many mainstream christian churches though they have a number of unique values as well some of the beliefs  such as rejecting blood transfusions  are controversial but none are violentjehovahs witnesses are also forbidden from getting involved in politics making the campaign even more puzzlingin the early days of the campaign some observers believed the campaign might have been launched without the kremlins direct involvementwhen putin was asked about the ban in  he appeared surprised saying it was total nonsense and adding it should be looked into carefullysuch words from putin are usually interpreted as a signal to pull back but since his remarks the campaign against the jehovahs witnesses has intensified in the past year it has spread to moscow which had previously been largely spared arrests and raidsas the campaign becomes broader some experts have concluded it must be directed from the top of government and at least approved by putini think the decisions must be made at the top level said alexander verkhovsky director of the sova center which studies extremism in russiaextremely suspiciouswhile its unclear why the group is being targeted some experts see the churchs links to the united states as well as its size and active search for converts as likely reasonsthe jehovahs witnesses distinctive belief of refusing to interact with governments is also likely key verkhovsky said although they are permitted to obey laws and pay taxes believers are prohibited from joining the military or holding any government postsfor our authorities that looks extremely suspicious verkhovsky saidjehovahs witnesses have frequently become victims of authoritarian regimes they were persecuted under the nazis and in the soviet union where they were banned until its collapse in  under joseph stalin tens of thousands of jehovahs witnesses were deported en masse to siberia in russias campaign against the jehovahs witnesses has occurred as the country has become far more authoritarian under putin the same antiextremism law used against jehovahs witnesses was applied this year to outlaw the movement of the kremlins main political opponent alexey navalny who remains in a prison campsenior russian officials have stoked an atmosphere of antiwestern paranoia urging the security services to be alert for foreign groups seeking to undermine russia the broader turn back toward sovietstyle suspicion of dissent appears to have also brought the governments former attitude to the jehovahs witnesses along with itmy impression is that the antiextremism law is used when somebody  i dont know who but somebody  sees a religious movement as a political threat how they see this threat we do not know because they do not talk about it in public verkhovsky saidin such an atmosphere local security forces can also see extremism cases against jehovahs witnesses as easy ways to earn approval and promotion he saidthe united states has been increasingly vocal in condemning the campaign in december the state department added russia to its special watchlist for severe violators of religious freedom which also includes iran and pakistan the us in  also announced entry bans on two senior russian law enforcement officers in surgut over the alleged torture of the jehovahs witnesses therebut there is no indication the campaign is slowing down in february police and russias federal security service fsb launched raids across moscow saying it searched  addresses and made arrestsamong those swept up was yury temirbulatov a teacher and jehovahs witness who had spoken to abc news in the beginning of at the time he and others had been concerned the campaign might reach moscow but said they felt relatively safehe said back then that he did not understand why they were being persecuted he is now in a moscow detention center and faces up to six years in prison if convictedfor the past  years i teach people only to love to be very polite to be pay taxes to work hard he said

had particularly massive fires this summer amid recordsetting heat many other regions across the vast country also have battled wildfiressome factors behind russias endemic wildfires and their consequencesrecord heatin recent years russia has recorded high temperatures that many scientists regard as a clear result of climate change the hot weather has caused permafrost to melt and fueled a growing number of firesthe vast sakhayakutia region of siberia has had a long spell of extremely hot and dry weather this summer with temperatures reaching  degrees celsius  degrees fahrenheit and setting records for several days the heat wave helped spark hundreds of fires which so far have scorched more than  million hectares  million acres of land making it the worstaffected region in russia the fires have shrouded yakutias cities towns and villages in thick smoke forcing authorities to briefly suspend flights at the regional capitals airport the defense ministry deployed transport planes and helicopters to help douse the flames fedot tumusov a member of the russian parliament who represents the region called the blazes unprecedented in their scopemonitoring difficultiesthe forests that cover huge areas of russia make monitoring and quickly spotting new fires a daunting taskin  a federal network to spot fires from aircraft was disbanded and had its assets turned over to regional authorities the muchcriticized change resulted in the programs rapid deteriorationthe government later reversed the move and reestablished the federal agency in charge of monitoring forests from the air however its resources remain limited making it hard to survey the massive forests of siberia and the far eastneglect of fire safety ruleswhile some wildfires are sparked by lightning experts estimate that over  of them are caused by people from carelessly discarding cigarettes to abandoned campfires but there are other causesauthorities regularly conduct controlled burns setting a fire to clear the way for new vegetation or to deprive unplanned wildfires of fuel observers say such intentional burns often are poorly managed and sometimes trigger bigger blazes instead of containing themfarmers also use the same technique to burn grass and small trees on agricultural lands such burns regularly get out of controlarsonactivists and experts say that fires are often set deliberately to cover up evidence of illegal lumbering or to create new places for timber harvesting under the false pretext of clearing burned areasactivists in siberia and the far east allege such arson is driven by strong demand for timber in the colossal chinese market and they have called for a total ban on timber exports to chinaofficials have acknowledged the problem and pledged to tighten oversight but russias farflung territory and regulatory loopholes make it hard to halt the illegal activitycritics blame the  forest code that gave control over timberlands to regional authorities and businesses eroding centralized monitoring fueling corruption and contributing to illegal treecutting practices that help spawn fires controversial regulationsrussian law allows authorities to let wildfires burn in certain areas if the potential damage is considered not worth the costs of containing them critics have long assailed the provision arguing it encourages inaction by authorities and slows firefighting efforts so a blaze that could have been extinguished at a relatively small cost is often allowed to burn uncontrolledthey eventually have to extinguish it anyway but the damage and the costs are incomparable said mikhail kreindlin of greenpeace russialongterm consequencesin addition to destroying trees wildfires also kill wildlife and pose a threat to human health by polluting the aircarbon emissions from fires and the destruction of forests which are a major source of oxygen also contribute to global warming and its potentially catastrophic impactthis years fires in siberia already have emitted more carbon than those in some previous years according to mark parrington a senior scientist at the european centre for mediumrange weather forecastshe said the peat fires that are common in siberia and many other russian regions are particularly harmful in terms of emissions because peat has been absorbing carbon for tens of thousands of years then its releasing all that carbon back into the atmosphere parrington said while pledging adherence to the paris agreement on climate change russian officials often underline the key role played by their forests in slowing down global warming however regular wildfires have the opposite effect dramatically boosting carbon emissionsthey emphasize that huge areas are covered by forests but neglect the effect of greenhouse gas emissions resulting from fires greenpeaces kreindlin said russia blocks access to websites of alexei navalny and close allies  russia  the guardian russia blocks access to websites of

independent journalists and human rights activists ahead of the countrys parliamentary election the september vote is widely seen as an important part of vladimir putins efforts to cement his rule before a  presidential electionputin who has been in power for more than two decades pushed through constitutional changes last year that would potentially allow him to hold on to power until navalnys

ordered to serve two and a half years in prison in february for violating the terms of a suspended sentence from a  embezzlement conviction that he dismissed as politically motivatedhis arrest and imprisonment prompted a wave of protests across russias  time zones in what appeared to be a major challenge to the kremlin the authorities responded with mass arrests of demonstrators and the criminal prosecution of navalnys closest associatesthe government has also outlawed the anticorruption foundation which navalny founded  years ago and has published dozens of widely watched videos exposing the alleged corruption of senior officials as an extremist group along with the network of regional offices he had relied on to organise proteststhe ruling not only barred the foundation and the offices from operating but also prevents people associated with them from seeking public office and exposes them to lengthy prison termsnavalnys team pointed out on monday that the smart voting

capabilitiesa notable change from  is the greatly expanded definition of subversion including a long list of behavior by nonstate actors that are said to be undermining russian values and the stability of the state dartmouth professor william wohlforth said in an interviewthese include also humanitarian organizations like human rights watch and western tech companies like twitter and facebookthe new document expresses concern over western governments manipulation of russian affairs the declaration of a ‘safe information space as a core national interest underscores the importance of information war to the russian government said ivana stradner a fellow at the american enterprise institute specializing in law eastern europe and hybrid warfare this is a continuation of the russian governments pathological selfvictimhood these claims like russias threats to ban twitter this past spring are aimed at bolstering russian claims of ‘digital sovereignty through which president vladimir putin believes he can stave off the types of ‘color revolutions that have toppled other dictators in postsoviet nationsthats not necessarily new even if it is new to this document said samuel bendett a cna adviser who is an adjunct senior fellow at the center for a new american securityrussia sees itself as a target of persistent and ongoing information operations by the west against russian federation targets like the military and security organizations along with critical infrastructure this new national security strategy officially elevates these information and cyber threats to the level of an existential challenge to russias longterm survival bendett saidthe strategy isnt just bad news for nongovernmental organizations it also pushes for russia to engage other countries to partner with russia on cybersecurity issues according to russias definition of cyber securitythis is significant because russia has already been using un subcommittees to frustrate us efforts to develop a cybercrime treaty stradner said russia even managed to beat out the us for the uns approval to draft a global cybercrime treaty she called it part of russias broader revanchist strategy to use international organizations to regain its sovietera prestige and powerrussia scholar mark galeotti described the strategy as paranoid particularly in the way it describes russian traditional values as under constant threat from the westrelated articlesrussias latest hack shows how useful ‘criminal groups are to the kremlinbiden urges putin to give up russian ransomware gangsters threatens

rights watch and facebook in the same array of hostile forces this in effect reclassifies the modern world and all the social and economic revolutions that are reshaping it as a threatthe strategy document suggests a growing role for russian intelligence services like the fsb and the svr in addition to the information arms of the gru all entities that have carried out advanced information warfare operations against western targets in essence the document serves as a mandate to expand their activities russia has denied evidencebased allegations about its role in cyber operationswe can expect this new strategy to manifest in the foreign development of intelligence missions similar to the internet research agency which has been linked to multiple meddling operations across the west stradner saidthe strategy release was delayed likely due to the us presidential election since the outcome of the election would directly affect russian strategy according to a brief by intel firm intelligence online the biden administration has been pressing the kremlin to curb russian ransomware hackers who have struck western targets from within russian borders or nearby friendly statesyou could say some of the sections of the strategy are setting up a rhetorical trap for moscow wohlforth said after all if all these actions by multinational corporations ngos and the like are seen as

me is proof  of ukraines provocative policy both in the region and with regards to russia this is the proof of the us intentions regarding building relations with ukraine itself when the russian factor is at the center of these relations she saidaccording to the diplomat such statements are in the interests of the collective west since they lead to the destabilization of the situation in ukraine she continued an attempt to endlessly play the ukrainian card in the context of russia has become the essence of western policy in the regionthe spokeswoman added that the provocative policy of ukrainian authorities above all hurts its own citizens the ukrainian people dont need this this contradicts the ingrained opinions of the ukrainian citizens regardless of their political inclinations since they need stabilityat the same time the diplomat expressed confidence that this was not the last provocative statement on the part of the current ukrainian governmentukrainian

power for more than two decades pushed through constitutional changes last year that would potentially allow him to hold on to power until in recent months russian authorities have increased the pressure on independent news media designating two popular independent outlets meduza and vtimes as foreign agents and outlawing the publisher of the proekt investigative media outlet while also listing its journalists as foreign agents vtimes shut down shortly after thatlast month a moscow court outlawed organisations founded by imprisoned russian opposition leader alexei navalny by labelling them extremist the ruling barred people associated with navalnys foundation for fighting corruption and his sprawling regional network from seeking public office many of navalnys allies had

recent weeks appear meant to provoke a response the top us navy admiral in europe said on july nato militaries conducted exercises in the black sea from midjune to midjuly the largest of which sea breeze involved  ships and  aircraft from  countriesin the days before sea breeze began on june  russian aircraft conducted what western officials called unsafe flights around nato warships in the black sea russian and nato forces continued to operate near each other in the black sea and mediterranean sea over the following weeksthe latest encounters came amid heightened military activity in the region but such interactions are not uncommon in the black sea which has remained tense since russias  seizure of crimeanato allies and partners operating in that area by themselves are constantly shadowed by russian vessels and by and large those interactions are safe and professional although theyre meant to intimidate adm robert burke commander of us navy forces in europe and africa said at a us navy memorial eventwhen a strike aircraft overflies a destroyer at  feet altitude and right over top our commanding officers are making a judgment call whether that strike fighter is on an attack profile or not burke added it could be argued that theyre baiting us into shooting first were not going to do that first without provocation but im also not going to ask my commanding officers to take the first shot on the chinrussian and nato forces frequently operate in close proximity russia regularly reports intercepts of nato aircraft flying near russian borders nato militaries often intercept russian aircraft flying near their bordersus officials have on multiple occasions criticized russia for what they call unsafe and unprofessional intercepts of us aircraft and warships in the seas around europe those include lowaltitude flights over us warships which are especially risky because of uncertainty about intent and the potential for accidentsin the past russian aircraft would fly without weapons in a configuration called wings clean burkes predecessor nowretired adm james foggo said in in the interactions and the intercepts i see today theyre coming out wings dirty or they have weapons on board foggo said at the time thats another bit of the calculus that goes in the commanding officers mind on  what is the intent of that pilotin his remarks this month burke said those close encounters have tactical risk that could turn into a strategic issuethats a big concern with this increasing aggressiveness so well have to watch that very closely burke addedrussian and nato forces have continued to train in the black sea since sea breeze ended on july  nato navies worked on interoperability and readiness while russianaircraft and coastaldefense units practiced attacking enemy forcesburke said this month that the seizure of crimea was an extreme form of constant bullying by russia that is meant to influence other countries and the russian publicthat russian action including military buildups and restricting access to international waters ultimately results in some nations avoiding going to those areas which is exactly the behavior change that the russians are seeking burke saidrussia is not  feet tall and its leaders understand and respect nato capabilities but it has heavily modernized its military particularly its submarines and learned from watching the us fight in iraq and afghanistan burke saidthe russian government is still very much an existential threat to the united states burke said i think is as much of a threat today as the soviet union was

ban in  reduced to two years by the court of arbitration for sport in  they were forced to accept that if russian athletes were going to compete they could not do so under their own flagthey hardly went deep undercover though at the  pyeongchang winter olympics they wore plain grey uniforms and took the podium to the olympic anthem by contrast while the  russians in tokyo couldnt compete under the russian flag their symbol was the olympic logo in its white blue and red colours and their white uniforms were emblazoned in blue and red instead of the russian national anthem they celebrated victories to piano concerto no  by tchaikovsky and that anthem was often heard russia came fifth in the medals table and third in the total number of medals won while the athletes were formally part of the ‘roc team in practice everyone called them the russians this hardly counted as a particular blow to moscow indeed if anything it generated a certain belligerent defiance the foreign ministry issued a video in which sharptongued spokesperson maria zakharova was shown boxing a mannequin marked ‘press before answering staged questions about the russian presence in tokyo in which she saidthat ‘the status does not matter the most important thing is the pride our sportsmen have and the world knows this her video ended with the moderately witty hashtag wewillrocyou that became a leitmotif of the russian responsenor was this just the government the famous dj smash mixed queens ‘we will rock you with piano concerto no  and this became something of an unofficial theme for videos posted on tiktok showing russian successesof course the reason why moscow is still annoyed about the roc designation is because they do believe they have been singled out for special and hostile treatment the official line is that the doping programme did not happen the unofficial one is that everyonedopes but only the russians get punished there may be some truth in that although institutionalised doping operations like russias may be rare the economistpulled together a range of surveys to suggest that ‘between  and  per cent of athletes in tokyo might be cheating meanwhile russian athletes who may

signals from moscow to its rivals about its capabilities and how it was willing to use them experts said this monthon june  russian combat aircraft flew over the british destroyer hms defender as it conducted an innocent passage in the black sea near crimearussia said it fired warning shots and dropped bombs near the warship which the uk denied though the british defense minister said russian jets performed maneuvers that were neither safe nor professionalin the same area a day later russian jets repeatedly flew close to dutch frigate hnlms evertsen while conducting mock attacks creating what the dutch defense ministry called a dangerous situationevertsens commander said it was in international waters and that the russian actions were irresponsible and unsafethose incidents have a larger message said matthew rojansky the director of the wilson centers kennan institutemoscow is increasingly willing and able to enforce what it sees as territorial and operational red lines and crimea and the black sea are a major focus of attention rojansky saidtensions remain high after russias  seizure of crimea from ukraine and moscow has sought to set the precedent that it controls its territorial claims there rojansky said citing the  kerch strait incidentall this traces back to putins words in march  when he justified the russian seizure of crimea as being about keeping nato out rojansky addedrussias military drilled around crimea throughout the end of june and early july focusing on attacking the ships of a notional enemy the us and ukrainianled exercise sea breeze also kicked off in late june and was the largest iteration in its year history with  countries participatingmoscow described sea breeze as openly antirussian but us and nato officials stressed that it was defensive in nature and done in accordance with international lawits one of the most robust sea breeze exercises weve conducted to date and were proud of that the chief pentagon spokesperson john

that russia used the british deployment as an opportunity to train strike missions against nato shipsmidjune also saw a major russian exercise in the central pacific ocean with warships and aircraft

nautical miles of the islandsrussian longrangebomber operations during the exercise twice promptedus f fighters to scramble for potential intercepts though us officials said russian aircraft never
