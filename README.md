# Actual trends about Russia in the English-language news
In this project I researched English-language news about Russia for the last month and visualized the 50 most mentioned trends using word cloud
# File opening order:
* Scraping news about Russia.ipynb - code to parse articles and save them to a json-file as a list
* all_text_about_russia.json - the resulting news list
* News Analysis.ipynb - analyzing and processing text from a json-file, then identifying trends and saving to the image
* wordcloud_output.jpg - result
* fdist.json - a dictionary where the key is a word and the value is the number of occurrences
