# data-science-and-fried-peaches
This repository contains my data science/machine learning projects. Hope it might be interesting;)

we are given 12 files. in each of them - a sales report for one month. In this case, you need to find out:
- the best month for sales. How much revenue was generated this month?
- the city with the highest sales
- what is the best time to show ads?
- what products were most often bought together?
- which product was bought the most time? why?
