# Online school dropout analysis
The goal of the project is to analyze why students leave online school and plot graphs.
# What's done:
* The data set fields are converted to the required type. Fields with a missing age value are removed from the dataset
* A graph of dropout of students has been built depending on the course on which they study
* A graph of dropout of students has been built depending on age
* The hypothesis was tested that children younger than 12 and older than 14 years are more likely to left the course
