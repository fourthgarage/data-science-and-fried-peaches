  "Russia Brings a New Criminal Charge Against Navalny - The New York Times",
  "Advertisement\nSupported by\nRussia Brings a New Criminal Charge Against Navalny\nThe jailed opposition leader faces three additional years in prison — enough to keep him locked away until after the presidential election in 2024.\nBy Anton Troianovski\nMOSCOW — The Russian authorities announced a new criminal charge against Aleksei A. Navalny on Wednesday, signaling they would try to keep the imprisoned opposition leader behind bars until well after the country’s presidential election in 2024.\nRussia’s Investigative Committee said in a statement that Mr. Navalny was charged with creating an organization that “infringes on the personal integrity and rights of citizens,” a crime punishable by as much as three years in prison. Mr. Navalny was jailed in January for violating parole and given a two-and-a-half year prison sentence that expires in late 2023.\nThe Investigative Committee, a powerful law-enforcement body, alleged that Mr. Navalny had broken the law by establishing his Anti-Corruption Foundation, a group Russia outlawed as extremist earlier this year.\n“The foundation’s activities involved encouraging citizens to commit illegal acts,” such as attending unauthorized protests, the committee’s statement said.\nThe Anti-Corruption Foundation produced Mr. Navalny’s best-known material. Its slickly produced investigations of the Russian elite’s misdeeds and secrets, such as an estate hidden on the Black Sea that was said to be a presidential palace, garnered millions of views on YouTube.\nThe organization also, prosecutors have claimed, sought to topple “the foundations of the constitutional order.”\nAfter years of tolerating Mr. Navalny’s opposition, President Vladimir V. Putin’s government has changed course.\nMr. Navalny nearly died last year after being poisoned with a nerve agent, in what he and Western officials described as a Kremlin assassination attempt. He spent months being treated and recuperating in Germany.\nOn returning to Russia in January, he was immediately arrested on a charge that his stay in Germany violated the terms of his parole from an earlier conviction. His jailing touched off protests across Russia.\nWith his organizations now declared extremist, anyone who has worked with him faces potential prosecution.\nIn years past, the Kremlin was believed to be wary of imprisoning Mr. Navalny for fear of a public backlash. But with the new charges, the authorities are signaling they are ready to keep Mr. Navalny locked up for years more. That would mean that in 2024 — when Mr. Putin is expected to stand for a fifth term as president — his highest-profile opponent would still be in prison.\n“No one infringes on the personal integrity and rights of citizens as much as Putin himself and all his henchmen, including the Investigative Committee, do,” Mr. Navalny’s team said in a post to the social network Telegram in response to the new charges.\nTwo aides to Mr. Navalny, Leonid Volkov and Ivan Zhdanov, have also been charged with crimes. But like many of his associates, they are now outside the country, seeking refuge from prosecution while trying to use the internet to influence Russian politics from exile. They are working to deploy a coordinated protest vote in next month’s nationwide parliamentary elections, hoping that they will be able to loosen Mr. Putin’s hold on the country’s rubber-stamp legislature.\n“We have to come together and be smart about how we vote,” a post on Mr. Navalny’s Telegram account said on Wednesday.\nAdvertisement",

  "Germany Arrests British Embassy Worker Suspected of Spying for Russia - The New York Times",
  "Advertisement\nSupported by\nGermany Arrests British Embassy Worker Suspected of Spying for Russia\nProsecutors accuse the British man of handing over documents to Russian agents for cash, amid growing concerns that Germany is increasingly caught in the cross hairs of international spying.\nBy Melissa Eddy\nBERLIN — An employee of the British Embassy in Germany has been detained on suspicion of slipping documents from his workplace to Russian intelligence, Germany’s federal prosecutor said on Wednesday in the latest case of suspected espionage involving agents from Moscow.\nThe man, who is a 57-year-old British citizen identified only as David S. in keeping with German privacy laws, was detained on Monday in Potsdam and his home and office were searched, the prosecutor said in a statement. The authorities said that they suspected he had been working as a spy since at least November and that he was suspected of handing over documents from the embassy to a member of Russia’s intelligence agency in exchange for an undisclosed amount of cash.\nThe arrest is the latest in a spate of detentions as German authorities move against Russian agents. Germany’s domestic intelligence service has grown increasingly concerned that Moscow is stepping up its efforts to win over Western collaborators to gain information about the country’s economic, political and strategic positions, as well as those of the European Union.\nMuch of the focus has been on the threat of cyberespionage after hackers linked to Russia were suspected of breaching the German government’s main data network and the country’s Parliament. But experts in Germany say that Moscow is again employing old-fashioned human contact to gather intelligence.\nGiven its prominent role as Europe’s largest economy, Germany has become an interesting target for espionage by agents from Russia, as well as China, Turkey and Iran, the authorities say.\nThomas Haldenwang, who heads Germany’s domestic intelligence agency, told Parliament last year that the level of espionage had reached, if not exceeded, the levels during the Cold War, when a divided Germany was at the forefront of a geopolitical divide between the U.S.-led democratic West and the Soviet-controlled communist East.\nGermany’s longstanding relationship with Russia has been shaped by deep cultural and economic ties going back centuries, and by devastating wartime battles that have left relations wavering from increased cooperation to bitter recriminations.\nThe poisoning of Aleksei A. Navalny, the Russian opposition leader whom President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia allowed to be flown to Berlin for treatment, only to jail him upon his return to Russia months later, reflected the complexity of the ties.\nChancellor Angela Merkel of Germany condemned the attack on Mr. Navalny, calling it an “attempted murder.” But she refused to take steps to prevent the completion of a strategic natural gas pipeline linking Russia directly with Germany in response. The pipeline, Nord Stream 2, is expected to be completed by the end of the year.\nIn a brochure published in 2016 and aimed at students and researchers in the sciences, Germany’s Office for the Protection of the Constitution warned that anyone who speaks good Russian and is pursuing careers in the diplomatic service, energy or finance could be potential targets for Russian agents. It detailed some of the tactics that they may use, including building up a personal relationship before asking for information.\nIn June, German police detained a 29-year-old Russian man working as a research assistant in the science department of a university in Germany. German authorities said the man had slipped information from his workplace to a member of the Russian intelligence agency in exchange for cash at least three times.\nA German businessman was detained in May in the city of Leipzig on suspicion of illegally exporting industrial machines to a company in Russia, where they wound up in the hands of a defense company.\nBoth suspects remain in pretrial detention pending the outcome of an investigation. A judge decided later Wednesday to also keep David S. in detention. The Russian Embassy in Berlin declined to comment on the arrest.\nItaly expelled two Russian diplomats on accusations of espionage in March, after investigators say they observed an Italian Navy official giving the envoys classified documents in exchange for money. The police said they also retrieved secret NATO documents believed to have been handed over to the Russians in previous meetings with the Italian.\nAdvertisement",

  "Russia: End of the road for those seeking to exercise their right to protest | Amnesty International",
  "\r\n\t\tRussia: End of the road for those seeking to exercise their right to protest\r\n\t\nAuthorities in Russia have eroded the right to freedom of peaceful assembly by using increasingly restrictive laws, and heavy-handed police tactics and criminal prosecutions to silence peaceful dissent -- to the point where it is almost impossible for Russians to protest in any meaningful way, Amnesty International said in a new briefing today.\nIn “Russia: No Place for Protest”, the organization documents how the clampdown on peaceful protests, which began with the 2004 Federal Law on Assemblies, has accelerated in recent years via a succession of legislative amendments and their ever more selective and restrictive application. As a result, there now exists a plethora of legal restrictions on when, where, how, for what purpose and by whom the right to take to the streets can be exercised.\n“Russian authorities have been curtailing the right to freedom of assembly with incredible persistence and inventiveness for years. No other issue has been given so much energy at every level of power. As a result, peaceful street protest has come to be seen as a crime by state officials – and an act of heroism by those Russians who still believe it is their right to exercise it,” said Oleg Kozlovsky, Amnesty International’s Russia Researcher.\n“The unlawful restrictions, requirements and harsh sanctions that Russian protesters face can only be described as Kafkaesque in their absurdity. It has taken the Russian authorities 16 years and 13 instances of parliamentary tinkering with legislation to make the right to freedom of peaceful assembly devoid of any genuine meaning.”\nNine out of the 13 major legislative amendments that have been used to curtail the right to freedom of peaceful assembly in Russia have been introduced since 2014, as part of a crackdown on anti-government protests and human rights guaranteed by the international human rights law and Russia’s own Constitution.\nLocal authorities have followed the trend set by federal legislation and introduced new restrictions on peaceful assembly. These changes have emboldened both the police and criminal justice system, with police officers using increasingly heavy-handed tactics to silence peaceful protesters and the courts handing down severe penalties against them.\nLegal restrictions on public assemblies\nRequirements for protest have become lengthy and ever more restrictive under the law in its current form. For example, people pronounced guilty of “crimes against the constitutional order, state security, social safety or social order” or of protest-related administrative offences more than once in 12 consecutive months, are barred from organizing any public gathering.\nUnder federal-level regulations, assemblies cannot take place near courthouses, prisons, presidential residences, and since December 2020, emergency services. But regional legislation makes these restrictions even more drastic: in Kirov Oblast, for instance, the local law prohibits any gatherings near cultural, educational, medical or entertainment facilities, shopping centres, playgrounds and even public transport stops – in effect, virtually anywhere in towns. Spontaneous, that is unplanned, assemblies are universally forbidden, and are dispersed with excessive force when they occur.\nSince December 2020, foreign citizens, foreign and international organizations as well as Russian nationals and NGOs labelled “foreign agents” by the authorities, are barred from financing public gatherings. In addition, assemblies of more than 500 participants must be organized and funded using a designated bank account or else they become illegal.\nOrganizers of almost all types of protests must submit prior notification to the authorities.\n“The ‘prior notification’ procedures are routinely used by the authorities to limit, under a variety of pretexts, the number of participants in a gathering, move it to a sparsely populated part of a city, or ban it altogether. Moreover, under legislative amendments passed in 2021, the authorities have obtained the power to ‘recall’ permissions under vaguely worded and unsubstantiated pretexts such as a ‘real threat’ of ‘an emergency or a terrorist attack’,” said Oleg Kozlovsky.\nHefty fines, administrative detention and criminal prosecution of peaceful protesters\nOver the years, the Code of Administrative Offences and the Criminal Code have been drastically expanded with provisions restricting the rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly, as well as the imposition of harsher sanctions for various purported “offences”.\nSince 2011, the number of specific, legally defined violations of the Law on Assemblies has risen from three to 17. The maximum fines have soared from 2,000 rubles (US$60) in 2012 to 300,000 (US$4,000) in 2021, and administrative detention for up to 30 days was introduced as a possible penalty for 12 out of these 17 offences.\nThe single most repressive measure was the introduction in 2014 of criminal liability, with a penalty of up to five years’ imprisonment, for repeated violations of the Law on Assemblies under the infamous “Dadin’s Article” 212.1 of the Criminal Code.\n“Besides being criminalized for exercising their right to peaceful protest, detained protesters in Russia are also subjected to unfair, almost parody trials, sometimes taking as little as five minutes, with no key witnesses summoned and the truthfulness of police reports accepted unquestioningly,” said Oleg Kozlovsky.\nExcessive use of force\nThe briefing also details the excessive use of force by police officers, who have been documented using martial arts techniques against protesters, battering them mercilessly with batons and, beginning this year, stunning them with electroshock weapons.\nDespite widespread public outcry over cases of excessive use of force by the police, like the January 2021 case of Margarita Yudina - a peaceful protester who ended up in an intensive care unit after being kicked in the stomach by a riot police officer - the authorities either do not take action to investigate and bring suspected perpetrators to justice, or they manifestly derail such investigations, which reinforces the climate of impunity.\n“It sends a clear signal to the police force that any excesses are tolerable, that violence is encouraged, and full impunity guaranteed,” said Oleg Kozlovsky.\nCalls for comprehensive reform of legislation on assemblies\nAmnesty International is calling for the Russian authorities to reform national legislation and practices to bring them in line with the country’s constitution and international human rights obligations. The authorities must prohibit measures that change the aims or place of public gatherings, as well as the number of permitted participants, unless such decisions are taken in judicial proceedings.\nThe authorities must also respect spontaneous peaceful assemblies – which should be considered lawful, when submission of a notification within the period prescribed by law is impossible or impractical. \n“Next month’s parliamentary elections give Russia the opportunity to change its approach to commit to promotion and protection of human rights including the right to freedom of peaceful assembly. We want to remind candidates for elections and future legislators that the right to protest peacefully is not something they can give or take away. It is something everyone is entitled to, and the government should respect, protect, and promote this and devote its energy to ensuring, not undermining this right,” said Oleg Kozlovsky.\n\r\n\t\t\tRelated content\r\n\t\t\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRussian Federation\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tStand with Belarus\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIran: Security forces use ruthless force, mass arrests and torture to crush peaceful protests \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEthiopia: Troops and militia rape, abduct women and girls in Tigray conflict – new report\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRussia: No place for protest\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIf you are talented and passionate about human rights then Amnesty International wants to hear from you.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrivacy Policy\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  |  \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCookie Statement\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  |  \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPermissions\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  |  \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRefunds of donations\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n© 2021 Amnesty International\n\nYour choice regarding cookies on this site\r\n\t\t\t\t\tWe have placed cookies on your device to help make this website better.

  "Report: China Is Hacking Russia, Too - Defense One",
  "\n                    BRASILIA, BRAZIL - NOVEMBER,14 (RUSSIA OUT) Russian President Vladimir Putin (R) and Chinese President Xi Jinping (L) aplaud during the BRICS Summit in Brasilia, Brazil, November 14, 2019. Leaders of Russia, China, Brazil, India and South Africa have gateheres in Brasila for the BRICS Leaders Summit\n                  \n                    (Photo by Mikhail Svetlov/Getty Images\n                  \n\n\n        Report: China Is Hacking Russia, Too\n      \n\nPatrick Tucker\n\nMuch has been made about the emerging relationship between China and Russia, two countries that the National Defense Strategy recognizes as near-peer competitors to the United States. They’re already collaborating on research, both are run by autocratic regimes, and neither has much affinity for the United States. But the marriage may not be as steady as Russia, especially, would like others to believe. A new report out of Russia accuses the Chinese government of hacking Russian state targets. \nLast week, the Group-IB security consulting group published a blog post describing attacks in 2019 against Russian federal executive authorities. The attacks continued into 2020.\nThe malware used in the attack, Webdav-O, bears an uncanny resemblance to code that certain Chinese hacker groups use, according to Group-IB, which was founded in Russia but now has offices in other countries. \n“Group-IB specialists established that Webdav-O has a set of commands similar to a popular Trojan called BlueTraveller (aka RemShell), which was developed in China and has been linked to the hacker group called TaskMasters,” the report said.\nA second Chinese attacker group, TA428, also hit Russian executive authorities in 2020. \n“Group-IB experts believe that either both Chinese hacker groups (TA428 and TaskMasters) attacked Russian federal executive authorities in 2020 or that there is one united Chinese hacker group made up of different units,” the group writes. \nThat matters because Western military leaders have become increasingly concerned about growing ties between the two regimes. A NATO communiqué from June noted that China “is also cooperating militarily with Russia, including through participation in Russian exercises in the Euro-Atlantic area.”\nChina and Russia are also cooperating on space initiatives to challenge the United States and a wide variety of technology pursuits. But many experts describe the budding relationship as a mostly cosmetic alliance, one that benefits Moscow far more than Beijing. As China grows in power, Russia could become more eager to claim their relationship with China is healthy and growing, especially around technology. \n“Chinese-Russian defense cooperation has generated significantly greater gains for China than it has for Russia. Over time, Moscow is poised to grow more dependent on Beijing as long as its standoff with NATO continues,” Eugene Rummer and Richard Sokolsky wrote in a Carnegie Endowment op-ed in June. \nAnother Russia watcher, Sam Bendett, said officials in Moscow had deliberately downplayed knowledge of Chinese hacks. \n“Since Sino-Russian high tech cooperation is elevated to the highest levels, with leaders of both countries publicly promoting such bilateral activity, any discussion of potential Chinese hacking against Russia was a ‘third rail.’ There were few, if any, public admissions of confirmation that such anti-Russian activities are taking place,” said Bendett, a CNA adviser and an adjunct senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security. “So if these allegations are true and the Chinese hackers were indeed state-backed, it shows the difficulty of trying to preserve Sino-Russian high-tech cooperation as above the hacking that is supposed to be done by Russia’s ‘traditional’ cyber adversaries that are constantly singled out by Moscow, i.e., U.S. and NATO.”\nWhen asked for his opinion on the report, Dmitri Alperovitch, co-founder and former chief technology officer of cybersecurity company CrowdStrike, said that Russia is “waking up to the fact that China has been hacking the world out of them for well over a decade.” \n\n\n\nNEXT STORY:\n\n              Climate Change Is Already Disrupting the Military.

  "Helicopter with 16 people on board crashes in Russia’s Kamchatka | Aviation News | Al Jazeera",
  "Helicopter with 16 people on board crashes in Russia’s Kamchatka\nConflicting reports emerged as to how many people survived and how many remain missing after Mi-8 helicopter came down in Lake Kuril.\nA helicopter with 16 people on board, most of them tourists, has crashed in the Kamchatka peninsula in Russia’s far east the local government said, with seven passengers unaccounted for.\nThe Mi-8 helicopter came down in Lake Kuril in the Kronotsky nature reserve, it said in a statement on Thursday.\nAccording to AP news agency, the helicopter is reportedly lying at a depth of about 100 meters (328 feet) in Lake Kuril, which is up to 316 meters (1,037-feet) deep with an area of 77 square kilometers (30 square miles).\nPreliminary information said, “there were three crew members and 13 passengers on board”.\nForty rescuers and divers were dispatched to the scene. Kamchatka is more than 6,000km (3,728 miles) east of Moscow.\nAccording to a local health ministry source, nine people were rescued.\n \n\n \n\n\n \n“Nine people have been found, they are all alive,” the source told the Interfax news agency, adding that the search operation was continuing.\nThe fate of the remaining seven was not immediately known.\nAn investigation has been opened for violation of air safety rules, said the Russian Investigation Committee, which handles air accident probes.\nMeanwhile, the Interfax news agency cited officials as saying the helicopter was carrying three crew members and 14 tourists when it went down in deep fog.\nInterfax initially quoted regional officials as saying that nine people, including two pilots, survived the crash, but later reported that only eight survivors were found while the search for the others is continuing.\nThe varying numbers could not be immediately reconciled.

  "Opinion | Putin is destroying what is left of Russian civil society. Biden must keep the pressure on. - The Washington Post",
  "Opinion: Putin is destroying what is left of Russian civil society. Biden must keep the pressure on.\nAlexei Navalny has now served more than six months in prison on a charge intended solely to silence Russian President Vladimir Putin’s most outspoken and prominent opponent, and Mr. Navalny’s organization has been gutted by the Russian authorities. With a steady tightening of the screws, Mr. Putin is decimating what is left of Russia’s civil society.\nMr. Putin’s security services attempted to poison Mr. Navalny a year ago, and he spent five months recovering in Germany. When he courageously returned to Russia on Jan. 17, he was charged, absurdly, with violating the terms of a suspended sentence in a six-year-old case that the European Court of Human Rights had called “arbitrary.” A Russian court nonetheless sent Mr. Navalny to prison in February for 32 months.\nAs thousands attended rallies to support Mr. Navalny, the authorities arrested his close ally Lyubov Sobol, among other well-known activists, on charges of breaking pandemic regulations. The public demonstrations, including one in early February, were met with force, and nearly 10,000 people were detained across the country. Russian authorities launched more than 90 criminal cases against protesters; nearly two dozen of these defendants were sentenced to jail time.\nIn May, legislation was introduced to outlaw anyone designated an “extremist” by the government from running for election. The bill was rushed through parliament and signed by Mr. Putin on June 4. Five days later, a Moscow court ruled that Mr. Navalny’s organizations are “extremist.” This effectively barred anyone affiliated with Mr. Navalny from running for office in September’s elections. Mr. Navalny’s backers had succeeded in a political strategy known as “smart voting,” advancing select candidates to defeat those backed by the Kremlin. Now his network of offices is closed. As the U.S. State Department aptly put it, “With this action, Russia has effectively criminalized one of the country’s few remaining independent political movements.”\nOn Aug. 3, Ms. Sobol was sentenced to parole-like restrictions for a year and a half, stemming from her January arrest on the pandemic charge, which she correctly called nonsense. On Aug. 7, she left Russia.\nAll of Russian civil society is under pressure. News organizations are regularly being labeled “foreign agents” and required to issue a disclaimer on every article and broadcast. Those singled out include Meduza; Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty; a business news site, VTimes; and an investigative news site, the Insider. Authorities raided the home of the Insider's editor in chief, Roman Dobrokhotov, who has often partnered with Bellingcat, the open-source organization that helped expose the actions of Russia’s security services, including the attack on Mr. Navalny. The investigative site Proekt was labeled an “undesirable organization” and banned.\nRussia used a chemical weapon to poison Mr. Navalny. President Biden is overdue in imposing mandatory sanctions for it. When Mr. Biden met with Mr. Putin in June, the American president raised Mr. Navalny’s persecution and vowed to keep up the pressure, because “that’s what we are, that’s who we are.” Mr. Biden pledged to “stand up for the universal and fundamental freedoms that all men and women have, in our view.” Yet two months later, Mr. Putin’s war on civil society grinds on.\nThe most important news stories of the day, curated by Post editors and delivered every morning.\nBy signing up you agree to our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy",

  "China and Russia show unity as Taliban bang on Central Asia's door\nDrills prepare for possible joint intervention if Afghan crisis spills over\nMOSCOW -- A large-scale joint counterterrorism exercise in northwestern China this week has highlighted Beijing's and Moscow's shared concern over violence spilling over from Afghanistan. \nOften regarded as economic rivals in Central Asia, the prospect of extremist groups gaining a foothold on their doorsteps is bringing China and Russia closer together, experts say. Some suggest that a Central Asian security crisis could even prompt joint military intervention, though others suspect such a partnership might quickly revert to competition.\nOver 10,000 troops from both countries are currently deployed to China's Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, along with a large number of artillery pieces, aircraft and armored vehicles. As part of the exercise, Chinese and Russian soldiers are rehearsing firing thousands of artillery shells at enemy targets, sending a fighter jet squadron on a joint bombing mission and launching a ground assault against hostile positions.\nA statement issued by the Russian Ministry of Defense emphasized that the exercise \"demonstrated the determination and ability of Russia and China to fight terrorism, and jointly protect peace and stability in the region.\"\nThe drills come amid a Taliban offensive in northern Afghanistan that has seen the group capture at least nine provincial capitals over the past week. The Taliban have made significant territorial gains since the U.S. began withdrawing its troops from the country in May. According to some estimates, the Taliban now control over half of Afghanistan's 400 districts, more than double what they held just a few months ago.\nThe worry in Beijing and Moscow is that the violence could soon reach other Central Asian countries. In another sign of growing alarm this week, Russia has also been conducting joint exercises with Uzbekistan and Tajikistan near the Tajik-Afghan border. Russian media on Wednesday said Taliban militants have seized control of Afghanistan's borders with the two Central Asian states, citing Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, Reuters reported.\nBoth China and Russia have significant economic interests in Central Asia: Russia has actively recruited regional states for its Eurasian Economic Union trade bloc, while China has heavily invested in infrastructure projects in the region as part of its Belt and Road Initiative. But while they both want influence, the crisis in Afghanistan is pushing any disagreements to the side, according to Vasily Kashin, a senior research fellow at the Russian Academy of Sciences' Institute of Far Eastern Studies.\n\"Russia and China have a common interest in regional stability which outweighs any economic consideration,\" he said. \"Neither country wants to see Central Asia become destabilized or have the United States establish a military presence there.\"\nOn July 28, Chinese Defense Minister Wei Fenghe met with his Russian counterpart Shoigu in Dushanbe, Tajikistan, to discuss the changing conditions in Afghanistan and Central Asia. The two defense ministers vowed to coordinate their efforts \"to maintain regional peace and stability.\"\nFollowing the current round of drills this week, Moscow and Beijing will hold another counterterrorism exercise in mid-September in Russia's Orenburg region. The next round will feature over 4,000 troops and is set to take place under the auspices of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, a Eurasian security alliance led by the two powers.\nIf the situation in Afghanistan continues to worsen, however, Kashin said Beijing and Moscow may start exploring more drastic action. He said that if Afghanistan turns into a launching pad for attacks into Central Asia, then China and Russia could very well launch a joint military intervention to eliminate that threat.\n\"If it becomes necessary to stabilize Afghanistan or the neighboring territories, then we will see the formation of a coalition under the leadership of Russia and China,\" he predicted. \"No one will want to act alone under such difficult circumstances.\"\nKashin argued that in the event of a Central Asian crisis, China and Russia would have little choice but to rely on each other. On one hand, the Russian armed forces could help compensate for the Chinese People's Liberation Army's lack of recent battlefield experience. At the same time, China could help Russia cover the financial costs of a major military campaign.\nThe two militaries already have some experience working together. China and Russia have conducted regular joint land, sea and air exercises since 2005. Many of these drills have centered on scenarios in which Chinese and Russian troops staged a mock invasion of a territory captured by terrorists.\nThat experience could prove decisive in the event that Moscow and Beijing decide to launch a joint operation in Central Asia, said Viktor Murakhovsky, editor-in-chief of the influential Russian defense journal Arsenal of the Fatherland.\nMurakhovsky explained that years of training had provided Chinese and Russian forces with ample experience of working together in coalition groupings -- military formations in which one country's troops operate under another's command staff.\n\"This is the only effective way to conduct joint military operations,\" he said. \"If creating such coalition groupings is not an option for political or military reasons, then successfully executing a joint military operation becomes highly problematic.\"\nYet, despite the strong political and military synergy between Beijing and Moscow, some experts caution that the two sides could run into serious disagreements as the situation in Afghanistan continues to unfold.\nAndrei Serenko, head of the Center for the Study of Modern Afghanistan, said that for the time being, neither the Taliban nor the government in Kabul was in a position to attain a decisive military victory. Such an unstable balance of power in Afghanistan, he argued, is conducive to cooperation between China and Russia since it presents both countries with an imminent threat: the creation of a sanctuary for extremist groups looking to target Central Asia.\n\"But if at some point in the near future that dynamic changes -- for example, if one of the sides appears on the brink of victory or a new external actor enters the conflict -- then we could see a battle for influence within Afghanistan in which Russia and China find themselves backing different factions,\" Serenko said.\n\"Under that scenario, we could very well see a situation where Moscow and Beijing become competitors, if not rivals in a political game in Afghanistan.\"\nSign up to our newsletters to get our best stories delivered straight to your inbox.\nDiscover the all new Nikkei Asia app\nDiscover the all new Nikkei Asia app\nStay ahead with our exclusives on Asia; the most dynamic market in the world.\nStay ahead with our exclusives on Asia\nGet trusted insights from experts within Asia itself.\nGet trusted insights from experts within Asia itself.\n\n                Stay ahead with our exclusives on Asia; the most dynamic market in the world.\n            \n\n                Get trusted insights from experts within Asia itself.\n            \nOffer ends July 31st\nYou need a subscription to... \n\n            You need a subscription to:\n        \n\n        Nikkei Asian Review, now known as Nikkei Asia, will be the voice of the Asian Century.\n    ",

  "Wagner: Scale of Russian mercenary mission in Libya exposed - BBC News",
  "Wagner: Scale of Russian mercenary mission in Libya exposed\nBy Ilya Barabanov & Nader IbrahimBBC News Russian & BBC News Arabic\nA BBC investigation has revealed the scale of operations by a shadowy Russian mercenary group in Libya's civil war, which includes links to war crimes and the Russian military.\nA Samsung tablet left by a fighter for the Wagner group exposes its key role - as well as traceable fighter codenames. \nAnd the BBC has a \"shopping list\" for state-of-the-art military equipment which expert witnesses say could only have come from Russian army supplies.\nRussia denies any links to Wagner.\nThe group was first identified in 2014 when it was backing pro-Russian separatists in the conflict in eastern Ukraine. Since then, it has been involved in regions including Syria, Mozambique, Sudan, and the Central African Republic. \nWagner's fighters appeared in Libya in April 2019 when they joined the forces of a rebel general, Khalifa Haftar, after he launched an attack on the UN-backed government in the capital, Tripoli. The conflict ended in a ceasefire in October 2020.\nThe group is notoriously secretive, but the BBC has managed to gain rare access to two former fighters. They revealed what type of person was joining Wagner - and its lack of any code of conduct.\nThere is little doubt that they kill prisoners - something one ex-fighter freely admits. \"No-one wants an extra mouth to feed.\"\nThis supports other parts of the TV documentary - Haftar's Russian Mercenaries: Inside the Wagner Group - by BBC News Arabic and BBC News Russian. Its other revelations include evidence of suspected war crimes, including the intentional killing of civilians.\nOne Libyan villager describes how he played dead as his relatives were killed. His testimony helped the BBC team identify a suspected killer.\nDescribing another possible war crime, a Libyan government soldier also recalls how a comrade, his friend, surrendered to Wagner fighters but was shot twice in the stomach. The soldier has not seen him since, nor three other friends taken away at the same time.\nThe Samsung computer tablet also provides evidence of the mercenaries' involvement in the mining and booby-trapping of civilian areas.\nPlacing landmines without marking them is a war crime.\nJust hours after the release of the BBC's report into Wagner's activities in Libya, the deputy public prosecutor at the Libyan Military Prosecutor's Office, Mohamed Gharouda, announced that an arrest warrant had been issued for the son of late Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi.\nAccording to the order, which was released internally last week, Saif al-Islam Gaddafi is wanted on charges of war crimes committed by the group during Gen Haftar's offensive against the capital Tripoli.\nHe was arrested during the 2011 uprising in Libya and later sentenced to death in absentia over violence against protesters. In 2017, however, he was released by the militia holding him.\nSaif al-Islam has long been suspected of having connections to Russia and the Wagner group, and is believed to be Moscow's favourite candidate to rule Libya. \nThe tablet was left behind by an unknown Wagner fighter after the group's fighters retreated from areas south of Tripoli in spring 2020. \nIts contents include maps in Russian of the frontline, giving confirmation of Wagner's significant presence and an unprecedented insight into the group's operations.  \nThere is drone footage and codenames of Wagner fighters, at least one of whom the BBC believes it has identified. The tablet is now in a secure location.\nA comprehensive list of weapons and military equipment is included in a 10-page document dated 19 January 2020, given to the BBC by a Libyan intelligence source and probably recovered from a Wagner location.\nThe document indicates who may be funding and backing the operation. It lists materiel needed for the \"completion of military objectives\" - including four tanks, hundreds of Kalashnikov rifles and a state-of-the-art radar system. \nA military analyst told the BBC that some of the weapons technology would only be available from the Russian military. Another expert, a specialist on the Wagner group, said the list pointed to the involvement of Dmitry Utkin. \nHe is the ex-Russian military intelligence man believed to have founded Wagner and given it its name (his own former call-sign). The BBC tried to contact Dmitry Utkin but has received no reply.\nAnd in our visual breakdown of the \"shopping list\" and another document, the expert says the words Evro Polis and General Director suggest the involvement of Yevgeny Prigozhin, a rich businessman close to President Vladimir Putin.\nThe US Treasury sanctioned Evro Polis in 2018, calling it a Russian company contracted to \"protect\" Syrian oil fields that were \"owned or controlled\" by Mr Prigozhin.\nInvestigations by Western journalists have linked Mr Prigozhin to Wagner. He has always denied any link to Evro Polis or Wagner.\nA spokesperson told the BBC that Yevgeny Prigozhin has nothing to do with Evro Polis or Wagner. Mr Prigozhin commented that he had not heard anything on the violation of human rights in Libya by Russians: \"I am sure that this is an absolute lie.\"\nRussia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs told the BBC it is doing \"its utmost to promote a ceasefire and a political settlement to the crisis in Libya.\"\nThe ministry added that details about Wagner in Libya are mostly based on \"rigged data\" and were aimed at \"discrediting Russia's policy\" in Libya. \nOfficially, it does not exist - but up to 10,000 people are believed to have taken at least one contract with Wagner since it emerged fighting alongside pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine in 2014.\nAbout 1,000 Wagner men are estimated to have fought with Gen Khalifa Haftar in Libya from 2019 to 2020.\nThe BBC in Russia asked one of the ex-fighters to describe Wagner. He replied: \"It is a structure, aimed at promoting the interests of the state beyond our country's borders.\"\nAs for its fighters, he said they were either \"professionals of war\", people looking for a job, or romantics looking to serve their country.\nThe other ex-fighter told the BBC there were no clear rules of conduct. If a captured prisoner had no knowledge to pass on, or could not work as a \"slave\", then \"the result is obvious\".\nAndrey Chuprygin, an expert working with the Russia International Council, said the stance of the Russian government was - \"let them join this thing, and we'll see what the result is. If it works out well, we can use it to our advantage. If it turns out badly, then we had nothing to do with it\".\nDownfall of Gaddafi in 2011: Col Muammar Gaddafi's more than four decades of rule end in an Arab Spring uprising. He tries to flee but is captured and killed\nThe country splinters:  After 2014, major competing factions emerge in the east and west\nThe advance on Tripoli in April 2019: Gen Haftar, leader of the eastern forces, advances on Tripoli and the UN-backed government there.

  "United Russia Wants a Big Win in Duma Elections",

The institution also serves as a vital means of communication between various segments of the population and the government, relaying grievances and concerns upward and distributing patronage and largess downward.\nUnited Russia, the ruling party, is defending their super majority of 336 seats but faces increasing challenges due to its own unpopularity and mounting grievances. Although United Russia is highly unlikely to lose control, maintaining a large majority is key both to ensuring its own cohesion and shoring up legitimacy of the Putin government.\nRussian elections are not entirely free and fair, but the actual vote itself has grown more secure over the years. This effort to secure the vote results from the government’s need for credibility in the form of a popular stamp of approval and in reaction to backlash over past instances and allegations of tampering. Although voting irregularities still occur at some scale, particularly at less centrally controlled regional levels, United Russia has primarily focused on limiting the ability of opposition groups to compete on a level playing field by making it difficult to get on the ballot, limiting access to media, and adding layers of bureaucratic restrictions.\nUnited Russia has strong political control over the Russian Federation; although over the years, the electoral legitimacy its rule is based on has started to wane. One problem is its inability to fully deliver on economic promises after a spate of crises following the 2008 recession. Reduced purchasing power and the dwindling value of the ruble have made the government appear weaker. United Russia also faces growing pressure due to its authoritarianism and association with corruption (or the “kleptocracy,” as the opposition refers to it). The Russian leadership has become increasingly unpopular, and United Russia has had electoral setbacks, such as losing nearly a third of its seats in the 2019 Moscow City Council elections.\nThe party’s goals extend beyond simply trying to maintain its majority. United Russia currently holds just shy of three quarters of Duma seats, and seeing its share reduced could have significant consequences. For starters, United Russia’s ability to modify the constitution of the Russian Federation, which it skillfully applied in 2020 well ahead of the upcoming Duma elections, could be severely hampered if its majority fell below two-thirds.\nPerhaps even more important, a reduced reserve in Duma votes could complicate the cohesion of United Russia as a political party or its ability to leverage so-called systemic opposition parties in the State Duma. As the electoral vehicle of a diverse Russian elite, United Russia is under constant strain from diverging political demands. The lower United Russia’s majority in the Duma is, the greater is the risk of splitting into factions as individual Duma delegates seek to exploit thinner margins for their own agendas. Such factionalism could also provide opportunities for Russia’s systemic opposition parties (the Communist Party, for example) to carve their own paths, lending support as a swing voting bloc. Currently the systemic opposition acts more as a lobbying group for its members and constituents than a unified opposition. Perceptions of an electorally weakening United Russia in general is also likely to signal these parties to detach themselves from the ruling party to strengthen their own positions in future elections.\nTo counteract the various challenges it faces, United Russia has taken a carrot and stick approach. For the carrot, it has sought to show itself as being a responsive government shuffling out or even arresting corrupt local politicians while also sidelining increasingly unpopular figures and promoting those with broader appeal. The slow downfall of former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev is part of this. The former president and long-serving prime minister stepped down as prime minister in 2020 to be replaced by technocrat Mikhail Mishustin. Although Medvedev remains the chairperson of United Russia, he has been removed from the party’s election list.\nInstead, Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shogyu and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov are at the top of the party list. Both men are unlikely to take seats in the Duma. Both are very popular as they are seen as standing up for Russia’s interests abroad and as being far less corrupt than Medvedev, who has long been exposed as having expensive tastes. Medvedev has been quiescent about his own sidelining, remaining supportive of United Russia and noting in a recent interview the risk of political instability that comes without a dominant party.\nUnited Russia has also attempted to bolster its economic image. Recent constitutional amendments contained a laundry list of populist economic measures, including guarantees for more generous pension and social benefits. The government has also sought to show itself as investing in a more prosperous Russia with bold development plans and a shift to more effective governance under Mishustin’s management.\nThe stick in United Russia’s approach is using various means of prosecution and harassment to make it difficult for the new generation of opposition, who are from outside the managed opposition parties that have long had a presence in parliament, to mount coherent campaigns. Most prominent among these is the decision to classify the imprisoned dissident Alexei Navalny and his supporters as members of an extremist organization, barring them from standing for the election.\nOther major obstacles also exist to opposition figures mounting a challenge. Firstly, any political party competing on the party list must first be considered legal, which can be difficult considering the electoral commission is far from impartial. After being approved, a party must then receive 5 percent of the national vote to qualify for a seat in parliament or compete in one of the single member constituencies. Independents can stand in a single member constituency, but to do, so they must gather 15,000 signatures from registered voters in the area within 45 days and then have those signatures verified. That’s a challenging task, especially as many voters distrust such petitions or fear their support of an opposition figure could lead to retribution.\nBy far the opposition’s greatest challenge though is its fragmented nature. The only thing that unites the opposition is they are against United Russia—beyond that, their policies, political ideals, and views vary widely. One reason Navalny was targeted was he—like previous opposition figures, such as Andrei Sakharov or Boris Yeltsin—was able to serve as a unifying figure for the disparate opposition groups to rally behind.\nNow that open association with Navalny is illegal, the opposition remains fragmented but still active; and increasingly, independents and younger members of established opposition parties are making isolated inroads against United Russia. It is plausible that at least a few seats will be lost to the opposition in this election. The opposition will continue to make inroads in regional and local politics by focusing on bread and butter issues. Yet the opposition remains deeply divided and unable to offer a coherent alternative vision for Russia other than being outside the established power structure.\nUltimately, United Russia remains in a strong electoral position and is likely to dominate political life in the Russian Federation for some time to come. With challenges mounting, however, the party’s focus will increasingly shift to maintaining that position domestically. This could represent a break from the past, when United Russia enjoyed the freedom—granted by its electoral security—to focus on policy rather than politicking. The party itself may also have to evolve in terms of how it shapes itself for this new role and how it deals with internal tensions that may arise from it.\nJeff Hawn is a doctoral candidate at the London School of Economics and Political Science’s department of international history.

  "Facebook bans Russian network for covid vaccine disinformation - The Washington Post",
  "Facebook bans Russian disinformation network that claimed coronavirus vaccines turn people into chimpanzees\nFacebook has removed hundreds of accounts it said were part of a disinformation campaign largely run out of Russia that also used social media influencers to peddle fake claims about coronavirus vaccines, including that some shots could turn people into chimpanzees.\nInvestigators said they traced the origins of the campaign to Fazze, a subsidiary of a U.K.-registered marketing firm whose operations were primarily conducted from Russia. The operation “targeted audiences primarily in India, Latin America and, to a much lesser extent, the United States,” according to a report published Tuesday by the social media company.\nFacebook called the anti-vaccine campaign a “disinformation laundromat,” whose efforts spanned Reddit, Medium and Change.org, as well as Facebook and its sister platform Instagram, where fake accounts were said to have amplified disinformation. Influencers on Instagram, YouTube and TikTok were also asked to post misleading content and use certain hashtags, the company said.\nThe Menlo Park, Calif.-based company banned Fazze because these actions violated Facebook’s policy against foreign interference through “coordinated inauthentic behavior on behalf of a foreign entity,” it said.\nFazze made headlines earlier this year when influencers including French YouTuber Léo Grasset — also known as DirtyBiology — said they had received a proposal from the agency to baselessly claim online that the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is dangerous and more lethal than the Oxford-AstraZeneca shot. That effort reportedly triggered an investigation by French authorities into the potential involvement of the Russian state.\nFazze and its parent agency, AdNow, didn’t immediately return a request for comment. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in response to past claims of Russian vaccine disinformation that “Russia is not misinforming anyone, Russia proudly talks about its successes and Russia shares its successes regarding the first-ever registered vaccine in the world.”\nIn May, Facebook said it had uncovered disinformation campaigns in more than 50 countries dating to 2017, when it began cracking down on political actors seeking to manipulate public debate on its platform. The company accused Russia of being the largest producer of disinformation.\nRussia is still the biggest player in disinformation, Facebook says\nFacebook has banned misinformation about the novel coronavirus, including claims about false cures and misleading representations about the number of covid-linked deaths, from its platform.\nIn July, President Biden accused the company of “killing people” by allowing the spread of misinformation about coronavirus vaccines. He later softened his criticism, though he still called on Facebook to be more aggressive in combating the problem.\nAn analysis by the Center for Countering Digital Hate, a nonprofit, of a large sample of anti-vaccine content on Facebook and Twitter found that the majority of the posts could be attributed to just 12 individuals.\nThose influencers and others had all significantly increased their followers during the pandemic. Facebook says it has removed more than 18 million posts containing misinformation about covid-19, but it does not share the number of people who have been exposed to such content. That number is likely far greater.\nFacebook investigators said the Russian-linked campaign began in November and December last year, when the network allegedly posted memes and comments that falsely claimed the Anglo-Swedish AstraZeneca vaccine could turn people into chimpanzees.\nThis spring, Fazze allegedly moved to undermine the Pfizer vaccine by posting a purportedly “hacked and leaked” AstraZeneca document that made the misleading claim that the Pfizer shot had a much higher mortality rate than other vaccines, Facebook said.\nThe Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine has been linked in an extremely small number of cases to fatal blood clots. The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, like other shots approved for use in the United States, has undergone vigorous safety testing.\nRussian vaccine Sputnik V is using Twitter to needle and undermine its rivals\nFacebook said the two waves of the campaign coincided with authorities in Latin America, India and the United States “reportedly discussing the emergency authorizations for these respective vaccines.”\nIn April, a month before the second tranche of the disinformation campaign, the Russian-developed Sputnik V vaccine took a blow when Brazilian health regulators issued a scathing rebuke and declined to approve the shot. The World Health Organization has not authorized Sputnik V for emergency use, though roughly 70 countries have approved its administration during the pandemic.\nFacebook said questions about the anti-vaccine campaign remain, such as who allegedly commissioned Fazze to run it.\nElizabeth Dwoskin in San Francisco contributed reporting.\nRead more:\nAnti-vaccine protesters tried to storm the BBC’s offices.

  "Ever Given Was a Warning of Risk to Chokepoints From Russia, China",
  "A leading-edge research firm focused on digital transformation.\n\n                Good\n                \n\n\nSubscriber\nAccount active\n                since\n                \n\nThe Ever Given incident is a warning about what Russia and China are capable of, top Democrat warns\nThe container ship Ever Given getting stuck in the Suez Canal in March was a billion-dollar demonstration of an overlooked security threat, a top Democrat in Congress says.\n\"I would have liked to have more focus and more people's hair on the back of their neck standing up, because I think a lot of people don't think about maritime chokepoints,\" Rep. Elaine Luria, vice chair of the House Armed Services Committee, said at a Navy League event in July.\nThe Ever Given was dislodged after six days, and experts were quick to note the military significance — in 2014, Russia sunk obsolete ships to block Ukrainian ships in a Crimean port. Disruptions like that are a threat in more places than most people think, Luria says.\n\"If you ask people if they even know what a chokepoint is they would probably come up with the Suez Canal [and] the Panama Canal, but not a lot of other ones,\" Luria said at the Hudson Institute this month.\nMany chokepoints are already closely monitored. The Strait of Hormuz, through which much of the world's oil is shipped, and the Bab-el-Mandeb, through which Suez Canal traffic passes, both have a heavy multinational military presence to counter threats from state and non-state actors.\nOther chokepoints are seeing increasing military activity amid changes to the security and natural environment.\nThe Greenland-Iceland-UK Gap, which Russian warships must transit to reach the Atlantic Ocean, is an area of renewed focus for NATO. The Strait of Malacca is a vital channel between the Indian and Pacific oceans, and China's increasing presence there has worried neighboring countries, particularly India.\nA more accessible Arctic may also make the Bering Strait busier. In March 2020, the US Navy's top officer said he expected that strait will \"at some point\" be \"strategically as important\" as the straits of Malacca or Hormuz.\nUS policymakers and military officials have warned repeatedly about China's presence in those waterways and at ports around the world.\nChina's construction of bases in the South China Sea is an effort to \"create their own chokepoints\" in one of the world's busiest shipping corridors, Luria said this month, adding that China's sole overseas military base, in Djibouti near the Bab-el-Mandeb, is also in \"an incredibly strategic point.\"\nBeijing has added \"a significant pier\" at that base that can accommodate an aircraft carrier, the head of US Africa Command said this spring, warning that China also sought a naval facility on Africa's Atlantic coast \"where they can rearm and repair warships.\"\nChina has also invested heavily in Latin American countries, which experts say it could leverage for military benefit, including around the Strait of Magellan, through which Chinese ships first sailed nearly a decade ago.\nAdm. Craig Faller, head of US Southern Command, has warned about Chinese investment in dozens of ports in the region, including on both sides of the Panama Canal.\nArmy Gen. Laura Richardson, who will replace Faller, told lawmakers this month that \"two ports on either end of the [Panama] Canal are owned by Chinese state-owned enterprises, and so that's very concerning.\"\nIn the Arctic, Russia wants to do \"the same thing\" that China is doing in the South China Sea by exercising control over traffic along the Northern Sea Route, Luria said this month. Even before Ever Given was freed, Russian officials were using the incident to promote that route.\n\"So we literally have the Chinese and the Russians who want to essentially create new chokepoints, and not only that but the Chinese have positioned themselves in a variety of ways at every major chokepoint in the world,\" Luria added.\nUS officials have warned that Chinese investments in infrastructure, particularly in ports, are being made with the goal of developing \"dual use\" capabilities that would support future military operations.\nWhether China has the political influence and logistical ability to establish such facilities is still uncertain, but the Djibouti base and other facilities that Chinese firms own or have stakes in aren't suited for power projection, according to John Culver, who retired from the CIA in 2020 after more than 30 years as a Chinese military analyst.\n\"I think that the [intelligence] community can maybe take a breath here about the dire threat of Chinese bases as locuses of power projection,\" Culver said in May. \"I think they're really more the accoutrements of a great power, especially a country with global trading.\"\nBut China's growing presence around the world's most important waterways still presents an outsize risk, Luria said this month.\n\"The interruption to the flow of trade and these geographic maritime chokepoints are ways that [China] can disrupt that are not just one-on-one, like naval vessel vs. naval vessel,\" Luria said.",

  "Russia: Black Sea oil spill much bigger than first thought",
  "Russia: Black Sea oil spill much bigger than first thought\nMOSCOW (AP) — Russian prosecutors on Wednesday opened a criminal probe into an oil spill off the country’s Black Sea coast that appeared to be far bigger than initially expected and left traces of pollution along the scenic coastline.\nThe spill occurred over the weekend at the oil terminal in Yuzhnaya Ozereyevka near the port of Novorossiysk that belongs to the Caspian Pipeline Consortium, which pumps crude from Kazakhstan. The oil spilled while being pumped into the Minerva Symphony tanker, which sails under the Greek flag.\nAuthorities initially estimated that the spill covered only about 200 square meters (2,153 square feet), but Russian scientists said Wednesday after studying satellite images that it actually covered nearly 80 square kilometers (nearly 31 square miles).\nWWF Russia has estimated that about 100 metric tons of oil have spilled into the sea.\nThe Prosecutor General’s office has opened a criminal probe on charges of environmental pollution and said it would seek damages.\nRussian media said traces of oil were spotted along the scenic Black Sea coast, including Abrau-Dyurso and a dolphin aquarium in Bolshoy Utrish, 25 kilometers (15 miles) to the west, where workers urgently put up barriers to protect the mammals. The spill’s oily film was also spotted in the resort city of Anapa, further west down the coast.\nHowever, Russia’s state consumer safety agency, Roskomnadzor said in a statement that an analysis of water samples along the Black Sea coast has found that it remained within norms.\nThe agency chief, Svetlana Radionova, said in televised remarks that a safety system appeared to quickly cut off the spill but wouldn’t say how much oil leaked into the sea. \nDeputy Prime Minister Viktoria Abramchenko met with the director of the Caspian Pipeline Consortium that operates a 1,511-kilometer (939-mile) pipeline stretching from Kazakhstan to Russia’s Black Sea coast to request information about the spill.",

  "Russia Bares Fangs Over Language in Kyrgyzstan - The Moscow Times",
  "Russia Bares Fangs Over Language in Kyrgyzstan\nIt began as a moment of nastiness between a sales assistant and a shopper at a games park in Kyrgyzstan’s capital. It has now escalated into an international incident.\nThe brief episode was captured on August 2 by a surveillance camera: A beefy Kyrgyz man glares at the young Slavic woman behind the counter. Suddenly, he snatches her calculator and flings it directly at her face. Later reporting on the attack revealed that the man was incensed that the woman insisted on speaking in Russian, rather than Kyrgyz.\nThe spread of the clip across social media has sparked a heated debate about who was in the right. One camp contends the man had no right to behave as he did. Others chide the woman for her inability – or unwillingness – to speak in Kyrgyz.\nProminent politicians in Moscow are wading in too, claiming to be concerned that Russian-speaking citizens may be facing intimidation and aggression in Kyrgyzstan – a fact that officials in Bishkek deny. State Duma deputies have alluded to another case in a formal complaint to their Kyrgyz counterparts. \nIn late June, a nine-year-old boy was beaten up at a sports training camp in the Issyk-Kul region in what has been described as an assault based on “ethnic and religious grounds.”\n“[The boy’s] parents found bruises and abrasions to his face, as well as mild wounds to his lower lip,” Indira Sautova, a lawyer for the family, told Eurasianet. “The coach told them that their child had got into a fight with some boys.”\nThe family later withdrew its criminal complaint after receiving apologies from the attackers and their parents. \nThat did not deter Duma speaker Vyacheslav Volodin from announcing on Aug. 9 that the Russian legislature was appealing directly for the chairman of the Jogorku Kenesh, as the Kyrgyz parliament is known, to personally monitor the situation. \n“This is not the first such incident. It is unacceptable considering that Russian in Kyrgyzstan carries official status,” Volodin wrote. “MPs are considering a response, which could include a ban on entry into Russia for anybody behaving in this way toward Russian-speaking residents [of Kyrgyzstan].”\nAn even more violent reaction has come from ultranationalist firebrand and Kremlin loyalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky, who led a picket on Aug. 10 in front of the Kyrgyz Embassy in Moscow. \n“Russians have for centuries, often at their own detriment, developed their periphery, built cities and enterprises, and brought enlightenment to Central Asia. Even today, hundreds of thousands of Kyrgyz families live off earnings in Russia,” he told the crowd. “Our patience is running out. We will demand a reduction in the number of Kyrgyz workers in Russia.”\nThere is alarm among some, like Kyrgyz MP Dastan Bekeshev, that the whole affair has become excessively politicized.\n“As far as the Russian language goes, it should retain its official status, since we have many Russian speakers here, as well as many citizens who go to Russia for study and work,” he told Eurasianet.\nAnd rights activist Rita Karasartova said in an interview to Eurasianet that continuing to dwell on this topic only threatens to further sour interethnic ties in Kyrgyzstan. The whole problem has, in any case, been framed back to front, she argued. \n“Non-ethnic Kyrgyz people do not make an effort to learn the state language because they know that Russian is an official language, and they speak Russian fluently. And as experience shows, these incidents occur specifically because one side is unable to speak Kyrgyz,” she said.\nEdir Bova, an ethnic Dungan activist residing in Bishkek, told Eurasianet that it was only natural that Kyrgyz nationals should know the country’s language to some extent, especially if they are working in the service sector.\n“Many are unable to learn Kyrgyz because of a lack of the language around them, considering that in Bishkek almost everybody can speak Russian. And then sometimes Kyrgyz people come in from the villages, they cannot speak [Russian], and when they run into the fact that everybody in the capital does speak Russian, it cannot but anger them,” he said.\nBova did rue, however, the fact that the state is falling short in its duty to promote Kyrgyz. Curious language-learners are able, for example, to find Chinese and Korean courses free of charge, but no such option exists for Kyrgyz. \n“That’s not the only thing discouraging study of the state language. The lack of high-quality teaching aids for Kyrgyz is also hindering its development. The government needs to allocate sufficient funds for this,” he said.\nDaanakan Kurmanbekova, 57, said she and her family found the language barrier made it difficult to adapt when they moved to Bishkek from the southern town of Batken seven years ago.\n“I understand that the Russian language can give access to a good education, but we must not forget that we are Kyrgyz,” she said. “It is only in Kyrgyzstan that Russian operates at an equal level to our native language. You don’t have that in other Central Asian nations, let alone the Caucasus or the Baltics.” \nThe noise around this scandal has a whiff of artificiality about it, though. Bekeshev suggested that Russian politicians may have their thoughts on the Sept. 17 Duma elections as they play the nationalist card. \nAt the same time, another Kyrgyz lawmaker, Irina Karamushkina, says a conversation is needed around the status of ethnic minorities. The seeds of a minorities problem were planted, she said, with the adoption in 2013 of a document titled Concept for the Development of National Unity and Ethnic Relations in the Kyrgyz Republic. In substance, the document formalized the idea that Kyrgyzstan’s citizens were organized into a “titular ethnicity” and “ethnic minorities.” \n“Until that moment, we all felt like full-fledged citizens. We lived, had our troubles, and toiled as one people. But then, slowly, under the guise of developing the country, Kyrgyzstanis of certain ethnicities were informed that their place was in the national minorities rubric,” she said.\nThis article was first published on Eurasianet.org.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Moscow Times’ team of journalists has been first with the big stories on the coronavirus crisis in Russia since day one.

But many climate experts see the staggering scope of this yearâ€™s fires as another sign of greater fire risks on a warming planet that is potentially being made even hotter by huge carbon emissions from the blazes.\nSiberia's fires are pumping huge amounts of carbon into the atmosphere\nRussia is fighting more than 190 forest fires in Siberia that have closed airports and roads, forced widespread evacuations and sent a pall of smoke across the North Pole.

In the Russian imagination, the dacha occupies a near-mythical place, and Russians of all generations fondly recall childhood summers at the family dacha.\nYAROSLAVL REGION, Russia — My mother-in-law, Tatyana, surveys her half acre of paradise. It's located at the end of an overgrown path, a few miles down a dirt road off the main highway to Moscow. The property consists of a three-room cottage with no running water, a vegetable garden and a trim lawn bordered by lilacs, firs and pines.\nTatyana and her late husband built the dacha, or summer house, in 1992, the year after the Soviet Union collapsed. She remembers arriving in a truck that dropped off their furniture in front of the little two-story house surrounded by wheat and oat fields. In the beginning, the dacha didn't even have power.\n\"We lived very well without electricity,\" Tatyana says. \"All day we were busy, walking in the woods exploring. And in the evenings, we would sit around a kerosene lamp and play Monopoly.\"\n\n                Tatyana Berestneva at her greenhouse, lush with tomatoes.

During the communist era, most churches were closed. While many have been restored, village churches often remain in ruins.\nIn the Russian imagination, the dacha occupies a near mythical place. Once the reserve of the landed nobility, the summer house gained popularity with urban professionals in the late 19th century; in the Soviet era the dacha became available to everyone, from writers to factory workers.\nNowadays, a dacha can be anything from a two-room shack to an oligarch's imitation French chateau. Every summer, Russian cities empty out as millions of people escape stuffy, cramped apartments to reconnect with their roots in the countryside.\nTatyana, a Muscovite, was initially drawn to the dacha because of the nearby forests with their bounties of berries and mushrooms.

  "Inside the Dangerous Consequences of Russia’s Space Screwups",
  "SEARCH\nInside the Dangerous Consequences of Russia’s Space Screwups\nExperts say the one-time space leader is swiftly becoming a liability for the countries it works with, particularly on the International Space Station.\nA space capsule with a hole in it. A rocket that failed 31 miles over Earth’s surface. An orbital lab with misfiring thrusters.\nThat’s the short list of the most dramatic mishaps involving the International Space Station in the last three years. The missteps have one thing in common: They all involve Russian spacecraft traveling to, or already attached to, the station—or station modules that recently arrived from Earth.\nThere was a time, 60 years ago, when the Soviet Union was the world’s indisputable leader in space. The USSR had the first space probes, the most ingenious manned spacecraft, and the luckiest astronauts—er, “cosmonauts.”\nToday, the Soviet Union is no more. Russia inherited most of the old Soviet space infrastructure—including what became the Roscosmos space agency—but Moscow has struggled to maintain it.\nFar from being a leader in space, Russia is quickly becoming a liability, several experts told The Daily Beast.\nThat has serious implications not just for an increasingly isolated, militaristic Russia, but also for all the countries that work with Russia in orbit, especially on the International Space Station. The United States, for one, might cut Roscosmos loose as it organizes ambitious new manned missions to the moon and maybe eventually Mars.\nThe Russians “have a worse record than any other major space power,” David Burbach, a space expert at the U.S. Naval War College in Rhode Island, told The Daily Beast. “China landed a rover on Mars on its first try, while every Russian attempt to reach Mars since 1990 has failed.”\nWith every year that passes, NASA has more options for productive and safe space partnerships. With every year that passes, it needs—and probably trusts—Roscosmos less and less.\n“The competition has become much stronger—SpaceX, but also other Western firms and China’s improving rockets—and Russia seems likely to keep losing market share if it can’t improve its product,” Burbach said.\nThe most recent Russian space mishap was arguably the most dramatic. On July 29, a Russian Proton rocket blasted off from Baikonur spaceport in Kazakhstan, a new science lab attached to its top.\nThe long overdue Nauka lab—that’s Russian for “science”—safely docked with the International Space Station. For a while, everything seemed fine aboard the 22-year-old station, which currently houses seven crew: three Americans, two Russians, and one member each from the European and Japanese space agencies.\nGenerally speaking, the NASA astronauts command the ISS and conduct science experiments. The visiting Europeans and Japanese are usually scientists. Roscosmos meanwhile sends skilled cosmonauts to maintain the station’s hardware.\nThere are actually two separate “neighborhoods” in the ISS. One for the Russians. Another for everyone else.\nA few hours after docking last week, Nauka abruptly—and totally on its own—fired its maneuvering rockets. The malfunction set the 356-foot station spinning around its axis, 250 miles above Earth. NASA controllers on the ground in Houston were powerless to intervene.  Only controllers in Russia had access to Nauka’s remote controls.\nBut the radio link required a direct line of sight. It was half an hour before the ISS’s orbit took it over Russia, and Roscosmos could turn off the thrusters. “Yeehaw!” tweeted Zebulon Scoville, the flight director in Houston. “That. Was. A. Day.”\nNASA at first announced that the ISS spun just 45 degrees before the Russians regained control. Five days later, NASA admitted it was wrong. In fact, in its half-hour spin, the thin-skinned station—which is festooned with modules, solar panels, and heat-venting radiators—rotated 540 degrees, in essence turning around one and a half times.\nTo restore the station to its normal position, NASA turned on thrusters for another half-turn. “Station is in good shape and operating normally,” NASA tweeted. The space agency did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nNASA told Space.com the ISS crew was never in danger. But Scoville tweeted that he’d never “been so happy to see all solar arrays and radiators still attached.”\nMaybe the ISS was in no danger of disintegrating. But NASA and Roscosmos are lucky the station didn’t suffer extensive—and expensive—damage to vital systems. Roscosmos did not respond to a request for comment.\nWorse, the July mishap is just the most recent screwup for Roscosmos. Most famously, back in August 2018, a Russian Soyuz capsule,which helps shuttle people and supplies to the station,somehow escaped the attention of Roscosmos quality-controls and arrived at the ISS with a 2-millimeter-diameter hole in it.\nOnce the Soyuz docked with the ISS, it began sharing the ISS’s breathable atmosphere … and started slowly venting that atmosphere into space.\nControllers in Houston and Moscow eventually noticed the drop in air pressure and sent the station crew on a hunt for the source. The crew patched the capsule and sent it back down to Earth.\nInspections turned up chilling details. “There were several attempts at drilling,” Dmitry Rogozin, the controversial head of Roscosmos space agency, said in televised comments. “What is this: a production defect or some premeditated actions?”\nA separate Soyuz was involved in another close call two months later. A sensor malfunctioned on the rocket boosting two ISS crew—an American and a Russian—toward the station. The rocket failed. The capsule containing the passengers ejected at an altitude of 31 miles and parachuted safely back down to Kazakhstan.\nA year later, Roscosmos had completed its investigation of the hole on the first Soyuz. But the Russians refused to say publicly what they found out. “We know exactly what happened, but we will not tell you anything,” Rogozin reportedly said at a science conference for kids in September 2019.\nIn the meantime, NASA and Roscosmos detected another slow air leak aboard the ISS. Efforts by the crew in late 2020 narrowed the location of the leak down to, you guessed it, one of two Russian-made modules.\nIf you’re sensing a trend, you’re not wrong.\nWhen properly assembled and operated, the Soyuz is perhaps the safest spacecraft ever. But it’s not hard to conclude that Roscosmos can’t be trusted to build and run the cone-shaped craft.\nAs for newer Russian space hardware such as Nauka … it’s as often as not badly designed, badly built and badly run. “The pattern of poor quality control in new hardware in the Russian space program has been around for many years,” John Logsdon, a professor emeritus at George Washington University’s Space Policy Institute, told The Daily Beast.\nTo be clear, space travel is hard and risky. NASA knows this all too well. The Space Shuttle, which NASA decommissioned back in 2011, was actually the most dangerous spacecraft ever. The bulky, fragile space-plane’s two fatal crashes in 1986 and 2003 accounted for 14 of the 19 fatalities that have occurred during space missions since 1961.\nThe world’s space agencies are eager to avoid adding to this grim figure, which helps to explain why relations between NASA and Roscosmos have gotten chillier.\nThe Russians used to enjoy a reputation for building old-fashioned, but rugged and safe, space tech. Today that tech is no less old-fashioned—the Soyuz capsule has been in use since 1966—but a lot of it’s also looking less and less safe.\nPavel Luzin, an independent expert on the Russian military and space program, has a theory. “There is a huge problem with human capital,” he told The Daily Beast. “Most people who worked during the Soviet and early post-Soviet times and knew how the Soviet technologies really worked—with all their pitfalls—are retired.”\n“The new generations of engineers and workers suffer from the personnel turnover,” he added. “Young professionals prefer not to stay too long within the Russian space industry because of over-regulation and lack of salaries. Even if they work according to all the instructions, they just don’t know the pitfalls.”\nA lack of money is the toxic thread weaving through Roscosmos’s problems. For a decade between the Space Shuttle’s retirement and the introduction of new American capsules, Roscosmos earned billions of dollars renting rides to the ISS on its Soyuz capsules.\nThe importance of those rentals belied the Russian space program’s funding problems. “Since the fall of the Soviet Union, the Russian space program has been chronically underfunded,” Chris Impey, a University of Arizona astronomer, told The Daily Beast.\nIt’s also possible Roscosmos, and specifically Rogozin, is a bit ... distracted. By movies, of all things.\nIn a surprise move in May 2020, NASA announced a plan to send actor Tom Cruise and director Doug Liman to the ISS to shoot a movie. “We need popular media to inspire a new generation of engineers and scientists,” tweeted Jim Bridenstine, the NASA administrator at the time.\nBut the Russians are determined to get there first with their own movie. Shortly after Bridenstine’s announcement, Rogozin threw together his own plan to send actress Yulia Peresild and director Klim Shepenko to the ISS to shoot a thriller that Rogozin would co-produce.\nThat production is scheduled to kick off in October, right before Cruise and Liman arrive. Rogozin’s fixation on making a movie in space, and doing it first, was reportedly the final straw for Sergei Krikalyov, a famous former cosmonaut who was working under Rogozin at Roscosmos but objected to his boss’ filmmaking ambitions.\nSo Rogozin demoted him, according to the newspaper Novaya Gazeta. If Rogozin is worried about the safety and reliability of his spacecraft, he’s certainly not showing it. But if the reporting is accurate, he’s not shy about punishing dissent.\nNASA needs Roscosmos on the ISS. The Russians effectively own half of the station and still provide vital services to the other half. But the ISS won’t last forever. The Biden administration wants to extend the aging station out to 2030 before turning it over to private operators.\nAfter that, NASA plans to shift its attention to a new station, the Lunar Gateway, which would fly around the moon in a wide orbit that would allow it to both support a new generation of lunar explorers and function as a staging base for a possible future mission to Mars.\nNASA is enlisting the usual foreign space agencies to help out with Lunar Gateway—with one big possible exception. It’s looking likelier that Roscosmos won’t be aboard.\nIt’s not that NASA wouldn’t love to keep working with the Russians, all things being equal. It’s one of the rare areas where Washington and Moscow aren’t rivals. “We are partners in space, and I don’t want that to cease,” NASA administrator Bill Nelson said following a June meeting with Rogozin.\nBut the sad state of affairs at the Russian agency, and Rogozin’s refusal to admit there are problems and fix them, might force Nelson’s hand. “Going forward the stresses in the partnership suggest that it will not last in coming years,” Logsdon said.\nAnd even if the Russians do join the moon station, they won’t occupy half of it like they do on the ISS. “If Russian hardware isn’t reliable, or even safe, that probably reduces their leverage,” Burbach said.\nIt’s not just that U.S.-Russian relations are fraying as Russia descends deeper into authoritarianism, invades its neighbors, and interferes in foreign elections. For the United States, breaking up with Russia in space is also a matter of safety.\nGot a tip? Send it to The Daily Beast here.",

  "Russia denies siding with Ethiopia in Nile dam dispute - Al-Monitor: The Pulse of the Middle East",
  "\nRussia denies siding with Ethiopia in Nile dam dispute\n\nRussia has denied taking Ethiopia’s side in its dispute with Egypt over a massive dam built by Addis Ababa on the Blue Nile, a main tributary of the Nile River.\nWhile Ethiopia, an upstream nation, says the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) is key to its economic development, Egypt fears the giant dam will imperil its water share from the Nile River, the country’s main source of fresh water. Egypt and Sudan, two downstream countries, have been seeking to reach a legally binding agreement with Ethiopia on the filling and operation of the GERD, a demand rejected by Addis Ababa.\nAs African Union-sponsored negotiations failed to produce any breakthrough, Egypt and Sudan requested a UN Security Council session on July 8 in an attempt to settle the decade-long dispute with Ethiopia.\nDuring the session, Russia’s delegate to the United Nations, Vasily Nebenzya, cautioned that the statements of a possible use of force to protect Egypt’s water rights should be avoided. The speech, however, was seen in Cairo as Russian support to the Ethiopian position in the GERD dispute.\nBut Russian Ambassador to Egypt Georgy Borisenko denied that his country supports Ethiopia in the GERD dispute, blaming the perception that Moscow was siding with Addis Ababa on “the misinterpretation of the Russian speech.”\nHe said in an interview with TEN TV that Russia, like other member states of the UN Security Council, thinks that the council was not the best venue for discussing water disputes. “Our position is balanced as both Egypt and Ethiopia are partners to Russia,” he said.\nBorisenko explained that Moscow understands that the Nile River is a “truly existential issue” for Egypt, saying, “We understand the concerns of the Egyptian friends about the construction of the Renaissance dam.”\nThe Russian diplomat said his country is ready to work with Ethiopia to reach a negotiated agreement on the GERD. “We are ready to assist in this effort, including working with Addis Ababa to reach a mutually acceptable agreement at the negotiating table.”\nA few days after the UN Security Council session, on July 12, Russia signed a military cooperation agreement with Ethiopia, raising eyebrows in Cairo.\nThe Russian envoy described the signing of the military agreement with Ethiopia days after the session as a “mere coincidence.” “The military cooperation deal is a framework agreement. It is one of routine agreements that Russia has signed and will sign with many of the world’s countries,” he said.\nOn July 24, the Russian Foreign Ministry denied any link between the military agreement with Ethiopia and the GERD dispute with Egypt, saying the deal “doesn’t have any destabilizing character” and is similar to joint cooperation agreements signed with other countries, including Egypt and Sudan.\nRakha Hassan, a former assistant foreign minister and member of the Egyptian Council for Foreign Affairs, said Russia is maintaining a neutral position regarding the GERD dispute. “Russia has major interests in Ethiopia and does not want to lose any influence there,” Hassan told Al-Monitor by phone.\nHe said Russia, like China, is of the view that the UN Security Council should not be involved in river issues, as both have water disputes with their own neighbors. “These countries believe that as long as the African Union is dealing with the GERD issue, there is no need for the UN Security Council to get involved in the dispute,” Hassan added.\nThe former diplomat said Egypt should continue to mobilize major countries such as the United States, Italy, China and Russia to pile pressure on Ethiopia to help reach an agreement on the GERD. He said, “The GERD is a national security issue for Egypt. If the dispute is not solved peacefully, the situation will spiral out of control, something which Egypt does not seek.”\nA research paper by the Center for Arab-Eurasian Studies attributed Russia’s support for Ethiopia to Moscow’s efforts to expand its influence on the African continent, taking advantage of the US estrangement with Addis Ababa over the Tigray conflict.\n“Russia is still groping its way in the African continent and does not have the influence to impose its own vision to resolve any conflict, especially in a complex and protracted issue such as the GERD,” the paper read. “Whether Moscow supported the position of Cairo or Addis Ababa, this will not change anything, but Russia adheres to what appears to be a neutral position that carries with it support for the Ethiopian vision, and with it Moscow can achieve several gains for its national interests.”\nSamuel Ramani, a tutor of international relations at the University of Oxford, said Russia considered a mediation role in the GERD dispute in 2019. He told Al-Monitor, “Russia, however, realized that Ethiopia is averse to any form of external mediation and that any attempt to arbitrate will just antagonize Ethiopia and produce no constructive results.”\n“Egypt interprets Russia's reluctance to back its position in the UN Security Council as Moscow being pro-Ethiopian, but in reality, Russia is trying to balance between Cairo and Addis Ababa.”\nRamani believes that the progress on the Russian nuclear plant in Egypt, the resumption of Russian flights to Egyptian resorts and reports about Russian plans to expand its trading access to the Suez Canal “suggest that Egyptian officials are compartmentalizing their disagreements with Russia on the GERD, even if they are frustrated with Moscow's stance.”\n“Back in 2019, Russia viewed mediation as the best way to balance closer ties with Egypt and Ethiopia. Now it realizes that mediation will actually undermine its balancing strategy. So Russia is pursuing a course of non-intervention in the GERD dispute, which is not unlike what the US and China are doing, and I don't see that position changing.”\n© 2021 Al-Monitor, LLC.

  "Russia Bans Bard College - The New York Times",
  "Advertisement\nSupported by\nRussia Bans Bard College, and Other Universities Ask What’s Next\nWas it because of George Soros? Or geopolitical tension? Either way, the future of academic exchange could be in danger.\nBy Stephanie Saul\nBard College, known for its bucolic campus along the Hudson River in New York, its creative and freethinking spirit and its emphasis on the performing arts, now finds itself in a strange position: defending itself against the Russian government.\nThe liberal arts college of about 2,500 students is fighting Russia’s decision this summer to place Bard on a list of “undesirable” organizations, effectively banishing the college from its affiliation with St. Petersburg State University, where Bard has successfully operated a degree-granting partnership since the late 1990s. The surprise designation makes any association with Bard’s program a potential crime.\nBard’s president, Leon Botstein, who formed the program nearly 25 years ago in the wake of glasnost and perestroika in Russia, said he was working through both the State Department and Congress, contacting everyone from Senator Chuck Schumer, the majority leader, to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on down in an effort to save the program.\n“If it doesn’t get reversed — because it’s a mistake — it will have a corrosive effect on any kind of scientific, cultural or educational cooperation,” Dr. Botstein said, adding that Bard pleads innocent to any claim it is undesirable, which he described as a harsh decision reached without due process.\n“You’ve got the wrong person,” he said. “There’s no crime.”\nThe government-forced dissolution of the partnership comes at one of the lowest points in United States-Russia relations since the Cold War, and at a time when international educational programs around the world have been buffeted by a variety of political crosscurrents.\nBard, whose campus is in Annandale-on-Hudson, N.Y., is the first educational institution placed on Russia’s list of undesirable nongovernmental organizations. One possible factor may be Bard’s longstanding and deep affiliation with George Soros, the billionaire financier and philanthropist.\nMr. Soros, who this year pledged what Bard described as a “transformational” gift of $500 million to the college, is a controversial figure in Russia, where he is regarded as a progressive counterweight to growing nationalist right-wing sentiment. Similar opposition to Mr. Soros led to the 2019 relocation of the Soros-funded Central European University from Budapest to Vienna.\nJonathan Becker, Bard’s vice president for academic affairs, said the affiliation with Mr. Soros and his foundation — which was already on the Russian undesirable list — was one possible factor in the Russian Federation’s move, but not the major one.\nInstead Dr. Becker blamed frayed relations between Russia and the United States, as well as the West generally.\n“There’s no coincidence that the announcement of Bard becoming an undesirable organization comes just after the Biden-Putin summit and new U.S. sanctions on Russia,” Dr. Becker said.\nIn a statement, Mr. Soros’s Open Society Foundations attributed the Russian Federation’s move to “an internal power struggle in Russia” and said it was most likely unrelated to Mr. Soros.\nBard may have also increased tensions by trying to transform its St. Petersburg program into a stand-alone public university. Dimitri Simes, president of the Center for the National Interest, a Washington think tank known for its Russian connections, called the plan “a bridge too far” for Russian security forces, particularly given Bard’s connection to Mr. Soros.\nDr. Becker, however, said the proposal to expand and spin off the program was not Bard’s, but rather driven by the program’s Russian faculty and administration.\nThe State Department urged the Russian government to reconsider its action against Bard, and, in a statement, called it “regrettable that a purely educational program would suddenly be labeled ‘undesirable’ after benefiting so many Russians and Americans and contributing to mutual understanding for a quarter century.”\nThe agency did not say what, if any, official efforts it had undertaken to reverse the decision. The Russian prosecutor general’s office, which made its announcement on June 21, did not respond to requests for comment.\nMichael C. Kimmage, a former State Department policy official specializing in U.S.-Russian relations, said the Bard action sent a chilling message to academics.\n“I can’t imagine any responsible administrator at an American college or exchange program who wouldn’t take this seriously and be worried,” said Dr. Kimmage, now a professor at the Catholic University of America in Washington.\nRussia has made several moves that diminish educational exchanges between the two countries, even as it attempts to build educational partnerships elsewhere and improve the quality of its domestic public universities.\nIn 2014, the Russian government withdrew from the Future Leaders Exchange program, a State Department-funded effort to promote U.S. study by foreign high school students, after a Russian teenager studying in Michigan sought political asylum. More recently, reduced services at consulates have made it more difficult for Russian students to obtain visas for studying in the United States.\nSuspicion in the United States has also been heightened. In 2019, a program at American University in Washington was criticized as too soft on Russia, and the Russian ambassador, Anatoly Antonov, accused the U.S. news media of Russophobia, while also calling for increased cultural exchange between the countries.\nSeveral American universities created programs in Russia after the collapse of the Soviet Union, but in recent years, some of them have closed. In 2018, Stanford University announced it was suspending its undergraduate Russian study abroad programs, citing security issues. That same year, Clark University in Worcester, Mass., began phasing out its program at Astrakhan State University, in Astrakhan, Russia, citing costs and the difficulty of managing its program from the United States as reasons.\nThe decline may be largely symbolic, a gauge of deteriorating relations between the countries. Russia has never been a major partner in international study programs with the United States, ranking low on the list of countries whose students come to the United States. And according to the Institute of International Education, the number of Americans studying abroad in Russia declined to 1,305 in 2019, the last year data is available, from 1,827 in 2011.\nIn an online discussion last week sponsored by the Carnegie Moscow Center, Aleh Tsyvinski, an economics professor at Yale, said a new law in Russia that placed all educational activity under government control — including international university collaborations — would create further barriers to international education programs in the country.\n“If you’re saying that everybody who goes on an exchange program or summer program in Russia has to go to the Russian embassy in Washington and have a chat with somebody there, I would say that 99 percent of the students will just say, ‘I’d rather go to Kazakhstan,’ which is more or less as interesting, perhaps, for them,” Dr. Tsyvinski said.\nThe Bard program in St. Petersburg, known as Smolny College, was an unusual model in international education.\nUnlike many programs abroad, in which American students take classes in a bubble while enjoying local cultural events, students in the program included many Russians who obtained dual degrees from Bard College and St. Petersburg State.\nInstruction was in Russian, not English. About 550 students were enrolled this year.\nAlina Putilovskaya, 23, was among the Russian graduates of the program who questioned the government move on social media.\nIn a Facebook message to The New York Times, Ms. Putilovskaya, 23, who works for a human rights organization in St. Petersburg, characterized the decision as “one more act of stupidity” and called Bard’s removal “a considerable loss, not only in terms of education but also in terms of the cultural exchange.”\nSince the program enrolled its first students in 1999, Bard College had embraced its Russian connection, hosting Russian students at its New York campus. Two years ago, St. Petersburg State opened a representative office on Bard’s campus.\nDespite the program’s successes, Dr. Botstein said, he was always aware of criticism.\n“There’s no doubt there was some suspicion that this was a kind of corruption of a great Russian tradition,” he said, but he still hopes to salvage the program, which he called “very dear to me.”\n“They didn’t intend this, therefore, I think it can be undone — I hope it can,” Dr. Botstein said.\nAndrew E. Kramer and Oleg Matsnev contributed reporting from Moscow.\nAdvertisement",
  "Russia’s Vaccine Diplomacy Is Mostly Smoke and Mirrors - Carnegie Endowment for International Peace",

They claimed Russia had trumped the West by bringing an effective two-shot vaccine to the global market faster and that the breakthrough would reverberate worldwide. Twelve months later, Sputnik V has failed to live up to the hype, and its developers at the state-run Gamaleya Institute in Moscow and the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), the country’s sovereign wealth fund, are growing uncomfortable under global scrutiny.\nData published in the UK medical journal The Lancet indicate that the Sputnik V vaccine is safe, boosts survival rates of people infected, and slows transmission of the deadly disease. However, lingering questions about data discrepancies and the lack of transparency caused an international group of scientists to question the findings in an open letter to the journal. Part of the problem is that the Gamaleya Institute rushed through clinical trials to get it on the market before all others, raising questions about the vaccine’s safety and slowing important regulatory approvals from the EU and the WHO.\nThe RDIF also misplayed global marketing of the vaccine. Distribution in Russia and neighboring countries as well as exporting of the vaccine have been hampered by production problems and a failure to manage global supply chains. International sales and distribution are increasingly overshadowed by reports of inflated prices and corruption allegations. Customers in various countries now want their money back for overpriced or undelivered supplies. Worse, COVID-19 is ravaging the Russian people in yet another deadly wave this summer, due in large part to Russian citizens’ own vaccine hesitancy and questions about Sputnik V’s efficacy—issues that Moscow’s rush to be first in the world helped to create.\nDespite all the Russian government’s propaganda about Sputnik V, average Russians do not trust it, a problem that is now reverberating across the former Soviet Union. Low trust in government actions and fatalistic attitudes are hardly new phenomena in Russia. However, Russian government efforts to downplay the virus during the first wave of the pandemic in 2020 and to play up the mistakes of Western countries led many Russians to become skeptical of the need for enhanced public health measures to reduce the virus’s spread. Russian disparagement of other vaccines since then has enhanced overall skepticism toward vaccination in general, with Russians often expressing hesitancy to receive any shot, not just Sputnik V.\nWhile vaccine distribution centers across Russia initially had a glut of vaccines for months, the latest wave of COVID-19 has led some Russians to reconsider that reluctance to get vaccinated, increasingly leading to Sputnik V supply shortages at home. Furthermore, the less effective and lesser-known Russian-produced EpiVac vaccine is sometimes the only option for residents of smaller cities and remote areas. As a result, Russia’s vaccination rate is just 18 percent, one of the lowest in Europe and behind many countries including Azerbaijan, Cuba, El Salvador, and Morocco.\nTo redress the problem, Russia rolled out new requirements for certain groups of workers and within specific regions that mandate or incentivize vaccination, including providing vaccinated Russians easier access to restaurants and recreational activities if they uploaded proof of vaccination to a central database. They received a specialized QR code to show at arrival.\nHowever, instead of increasing vaccination rates, this QR code policy led to new corruption schemes as Russians sought ways around the system, including via purchasing doctored vaccine records on the black market. Technology hiccups related to the QR code also reduced the program’s efficacy. All these problems caused the city of Moscow to scrub the program in late July 2021.\nDespite these problems at home, RDIF, headed by Kirill Dmitriev, has been marketing Sputnik V globally on behalf of the Russian state. Dmitriev, a Kremlin insider with a bachelor’s degree in economics from Stanford and a master’s degree in business administration from Harvard, is fluent in English and serves as a public champion of Sputnik V internationally. In fact, he has been deployed by Russian President Putin in the past to conduct sensitive operations for the Kremlin, including late 2016 through early 2017, when Dmitriev was involved in back-channel diplomacy arranged by the Emiratis to the then incoming administration of former U.S. president Donald Trump. Recently, Dmitriev has sought to improve the vaccine’s (and Russian science’s) public image through numerous interviews and has helped to broker high-profile deals with influential countries to buy the vaccine—again often through back channels and through his existing connections to the UAE.\nArgentina, Ghana, Hungary, India, Mexico, Nigeria, Peru, the Philippines, and the UAE are among almost seventy countries that have all authorized Sputnik V’s use and distribution. They and other states have struck deals with the RDIF to buy millions of doses, and in some cases, even made agreements to produce it domestically. Such deals made sense in late 2020 and early 2021 when there were limited other options. Russia’s Sputnik V was particularly attractive when Europe and the United States struggled with vaccination rollouts, amid accusations the West was hoarding vaccines while leaving others unprotected for years to come. The deals also likely boosted Dmitriev’s personal reputation within the Kremlin, and this bid for improved patronage in Russian elite circles was as much a motivator for him as the lucrative financial benefits to the RDIF and vaccine middlemen. \nYet Russia’s COVID-19 vaccine diplomacy has fallen far short of its original goals and has disappointed global public health officials eager for alternatives to the mRNA vaccines that are difficult to produce and store. Although Russian officials initially suggested the Sputnik V vaccine would be a key part of the global solution to the pandemic, Moscow has made only minimal contributions to the COVAX program, a WHO initiative to supply vaccines to poorer countries and emerging economies. The EU, United States, and other developed economies are major contributors to COVAX, although the program has been badly hobbled by rich countries’ stockpiling of vaccines for their own populations. However, Moscow essentially opted not to participate in COVAX, either through financial contribution or in-kind doses of Sputnik V. Instead, the RDIF has focused on commercially based bilateral deals in various parts of the world. \nHowever, the RDIF is also having trouble fulfilling its commercial contracts for the vaccine. As of May 2021, Russia reportedly had produced only 33 million doses out of 800 million it had promised. Dmitriev and the fund instead appear to be part of a smoke and mirrors exercise. With few exceptions, Russia has failed to deliver on many of its signed agreements, leaving some recipient countries, particularly in Africa, with only enough doses to vaccinate a few thousand elites. While the fund continues to push snappy public relations materials and social media campaigns lauding Sputnik V’s global success, international supply problems have left countries that rely on Sputnik V without enough doses to vaccinate their populations, including the elderly and other vulnerable groups.\nArgentina is witnessing a public uproar because several million people have been waiting for over three months for their second Sputnik V dose due to supply problems. The RDIF’s failure to deliver forced the Argentine government to raise the issue with Moscow in a scathing letter critical of Russian missteps that was leaked to the Argentine press. Buenos Aires’s decision to rely largely on Sputnik V has created political uncertainty for the center-left Argentine President Alberto Fernández, who suffered a COVID-19 breakthrough case of his own two months after being inoculated with Sputnik V. Since assuming office in 2019, Fernández broke with his predecessor Mauricio Macri’s skepticism toward Moscow and pivoted toward a more Russian-friendly stance reminiscent of former president Cristina Fernández de Kirchner (who incidentally is back in government as Argentina’s vice president.) The current Fernández government is accused of making a geopolitical choice in its decision to spurn vaccines of European or American origin and to rely on Sputnik V instead, although current supply problems have caused Buenos Aires to start seeking alternatives in recent weeks. Similar delays with Sputnik V deliveries have been documented in Bolivia, Guatemala, Mexico, and the Philippines, complicating those countries’ ability to fully immunize at-risk populations.\nUnfortunately, there is a growing body of evidence indicating that the RDIF’s marketing arrangements have involved overpricing and potential corruption schemes. In November 2020, the fund officially announced that Sputnik V would be sold for less than $10 a dose, cheaper than the Pfizer vaccine but still more expensive than the AstraZeneca-Oxford University shot, which is sold at cost. However, it appears that in many cases Sputnik V is being sold for much more than the initially announced price. Furthermore, Dmitriev’s ties to the UAE appear to be coming back to haunt him in a new context. Investigative reporting in Russia has uncovered a convoluted scheme in which the RDIF gave a UAE firm exclusive Sputnik V resale rights at inflated prices to at least five countries in Africa, Asia, and the Middle East.\nThe government of Ghana, for example, recently cancelled a commercial contract to purchase Sputnik V through a UAE broker at $19 per dose (roughly double the normal price) amid a parliamentary inquiry over corruption in vaccine procurement and non-delivery of the required doses. Similarly, Kenya blocked the use of Sputnik V after the country’s first 75,000 doses were revealed to have been delivered through the same UAE middleman, at twice the suggested price, as opposed to directly from the RDIF as Nairobi had expected. Kenyan health authorities initially were concerned the doses the country had received were counterfeit, particularly after Russian Embassy officials in the country confirmed there was no deal between the Kenyan and Russian governments on importing Sputnik V. Yet they were legitimate Sputnik V doses, imported and procured by a private Kenyan pharmaceutical company and offered to consumers at some local clinics for up to $70 per shot.\nDespite the EU’s stated willingness to consider Sputnik V for emergency use, the vaccine’s Russian developers have repeatedly missed deadlines to pass key data on its use to the European Medicines Agency—the EU regulatory body that decides on emergency use authorization for the entire bloc. Scientists and regulators in other countries, including the RDIF’s priority marketing targets like Brazil and South Africa, have raised questions about vaccine efficacy and the timely provision of data. Although Brazil and South Africa are partners of Russia in the BRICS consortium, Brazil’s regulator flagged concerns about the vaccine’s safety before only allowing some states to import the vaccine under highly constrained conditions. South Africa has a rolling emergency authorization approval process and has yet to officially approve the vaccine. There initially were concerns in spring 2021 about its efficacy against the South African variant of the disease, and the continued delay in approval now appears tied to insufficient data being supplied from the Russian side.\nRussian officials respond to questions about Sputnik V with fury. When international regulators or scientists question the vaccine’s efficacy and refuse to authorize its use, Russian developers do not rush in with additional data. They instead complain about market access and unfair competition from Western pharmaceutical companies in key markets. Russian officials also play to anti-Western sentiment, even claiming France’s hesitancy to approve Sputnik V is akin to “racism, imperial hegemony and neo-Nazism,” a message that likely is intended to sully Paris’s image on the African continent where the two countries have been locked in a media disinformation campaign. Russian-friendly media in Africa appear to be trying to amplify that message.\nSputnik V’s problems, however, are illustrative of Russia’s domestic and international challenges. The Russian population is skeptical of its own government and quick to find ways around government measures, which has exacerbated the public health crisis and prolonged Russia’s economic distress. Internationally, Russia’s growing aspirations for great power status have been far more symbolic than substantial, and its attempt to bolster its reputation in the Global South (Africa, Latin America, Asia) through marketing Sputnik V is running into reality.\nRestricted by significant resource problems and hemmed in by its own narrative of Sputnik V’s promise, Russia has had only limited successes in working toward its goals. Further, by overpromising and underdelivering, Russia is losing a real opportunity to provide vaccines to those countries in dire need of them, especially amid rising global concern about wealthy Western countries stockpiling doses. Moscow’s decision to effectively abstain from the COVAX program has done little to address the global public health emergency.\nThe distribution of Sputnik V is increasingly looking like an opportunity for personal enrichment and patronage for Kremlin insiders and middlemen. Instead of bolstering Russia’s image and its reputation for innovation, corrupt deals like those offered to Kenya or Ghana and the failure to deliver on its contract requirements in Argentina tarnish the image of Russian science and industry. Sputnik V is proving to be another example of Russia’s ambitions exceeding its capabilities.\nThe authors would like to thank Open Society Foundations for supporting their research. \nCorrection: this piece has been amended to remove South Korea from the list of countries that authorized the Sputnik V vaccine.

  "The Right Way to Split China and Russia | Foreign Affairs",
  "The Right Way to Split China and Russia\nAs Washington searches for an effective strategy to manage China’s rise, U.S. President Joe Biden is right to lean heavily on one of the United States’ clearest advantages: its global network of alliances. But even as Biden builds a coalition to tame Beijing, he also needs to work the other side of the equation by weakening China’s own international partnerships. He can’t stop China’s rise, but he can limit its influence by trying to lure away from China its main collaborator: Russia.\nThe Chinese-Russian partnership significantly augments the challenge that China’s rise poses to the United States. Teamwork between Beijing and Moscow amplifies China’s ambition and reach in many regions of the world, in the battle for control of global institutions, and in the worldwide contest between democracy and illiberal alternatives. Piggybacking on China’s growing power allows Russia to punch above its weight on the global stage and energizes Moscow’s campaign to subvert democratic governance in Europe and the United States.\nThe bond between China and Russia appears to be strong—but there are cracks beneath the surface. It is an asymmetrical relationship, one that pairs an ascendant, confident, and self-regarding China with a stagnant and insecure Russia. That asymmetry gives Biden an opening: to put distance between the two countries, his administration should exploit Russia’s own misgivings about its status as China’s junior partner. By helping Russia redress the vulnerabilities that its relations with China put in stark relief—in effect, helping Russia help itself—Biden can encourage Moscow to drift away from Beijing. Splitting Russia from China would check both countries’ ambitions, making it easier for the United States and its democratic partners to defend their liberal values and institutions and to shape a peaceful international system in an increasingly multipolar and ideologically diverse world.\nChina and Russia may be in a marriage of convenience, but it is a very effective one. China generally goes it alone on the international stage, preferring transactional and arm’s-length relationships with other countries. Yet it makes an exception for Russia. Today, Beijing and Moscow have forged a relationship that is “alliance-like,” to use Russian President Vladimir Putin’s term. It encompasses deepening economic ties, including efforts to reduce the U.S. dollar’s dominance in the global economy; the joint use of digital technology to control and surveil Chinese and Russian citizens and sow dissent inside the world’s democracies; and cooperation on defense, such as joint military exercises and the transfer of advanced weapons systems and technology from Russia to China.\nRussia’s tilt toward China has accompanied its estrangement from the West, which deepened with the extension of NATO’s eastern frontier to Russia’s western border. Moscow’s outreach to Beijing intensified after the European Union and the United States imposed sanctions on Russia following its 2014 annexation of Crimea and military intervention in eastern Ukraine. Beijing has reciprocated, leaning toward Moscow to magnify China’s influence amid mounting economic and strategic rivalry with the United States. Since Xi Jinping became China’s president in 2013, he and Putin have met or spoken on the phone around 40 times.\nThe Chinese-Russian relationship is grounded in a realist view of the world, and both countries reap mutual and individual benefits from it. Diplomatic teamwork advances their unifying goal of resisting what they see as the West’s encroaching geopolitical and ideological ambition. The partnership allows Russia to focus its strategic attention on its western frontier and China to focus on its maritime flank. Russia gets substantial revenue from energy and arms sales to China, and China fuels the expansion of its economy and boosts its military capability with the help of Russian weaponry.\n\nBut the two countries are not natural partners; historically, they have been competitors, and the sources of their long-running rivalry are hardly gone for good. The Kremlin is acutely sensitive to power realities, and it knows full well that a sluggish Russia of some 150 million people is no match for a dynamic China of nearly one and a half billion people. China’s economy is roughly ten times as large as that of Russia, and China is in an entirely different league when it comes to innovation and technology. China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) has made deep inroads into Russia’s traditional sphere of influence in Central Asia, and the Kremlin is justifiably worried that China also has designs on the Arctic region.\nThat Russia still cleaves to China despite such asymmetries is a potent sign of Moscow’s disaffection from the West. Yet the imbalance will only grow over time and will become an ever-larger source of discomfort for the Kremlin. Washington needs to capitalize on that discomfort and convince Russia that it would be better off geopolitically and economically if it hedged against China and tilted toward the West.\nSuch a gambit will not be easy to pull off. Putin has long strengthened his grip at home by playing to Russian nationalism and standing up to the West. He and his apparatchiks might prove too set in their ways and unwilling to countenance a foreign policy that is not predicated on such posturing. Accordingly, the Biden administration has to approach Moscow with eyes wide open; as it tries to lure Russia westward, it cannot acquiesce to the Kremlin’s aggressive behavior or allow Putin to exploit Washington’s extended hand.\nBiden’s challenge will be more complicated than that faced by U.S. President Richard Nixon in the 1970s, when he reached out to China and succeeded in roiling Chinese-Soviet relations and weakening the communist bloc. By the time of Nixon’s visit to China in 1972, Beijing and Moscow had already parted ways. Nixon had it easy; his task was to build on, not initiate, a rift. Biden faces the higher hurdle of prying apart an intact partnership—which is why his best bet is to stoke latent tensions in the Chinese-Russian relationship.\nChina and Russia have long competed over territory and status. The land border between the two countries currently runs more than 2,600 miles, and their disputes over territory, influence in the border regions, and trade go back centuries. During the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, China held the upper hand and generally prevailed. The tables turned in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, with Russia and other European powers resorting to a mix of military predation and coercive diplomacy to wrest control of territory from China and impose exploitative terms of trade.\nThe coming to power of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in 1949 cleared the way for a historically unprecedented period of strategic cooperation between China and the Soviet Union. Building on their shared commitment to communism, the two countries concluded a formal alliance in 1950. Thousands of Soviet scientists and engineers moved to China, sharing industrial and military technology and even helping the Chinese develop a nuclear weapons program. During the Korean War, the Soviets provided China with supplies, military advisers, and air cover. Bilateral trade mounted quickly, representing 50 percent of China’s foreign commerce by the end of the decade. Chinese leader Mao Zedong asserted that the two countries had “a close and brotherly relationship.” Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev called China’s communist revolution “the most outstanding event in world history.”\n\nBut the alliance soon eroded as quickly as it had come together. Mao and Khrushchev began to part ways in 1958. Their falling-out stemmed in part from ideological differences. Mao sought to mobilize the peasantry, stoking revolutionary fervor and social upheaval at home and abroad. Khrushchev, in contrast, supported ideological moderation, industrialized socialism, and political stability at home and abroad. The two countries began to compete for leadership of the communist bloc, with Mao remarking that Khrushchev “is afraid that the Communist parties . . . of the world will not believe in them, but us.”\nSuch differences were magnified by China’s discomfort with power asymmetries that decidedly favored the Soviet Union. In a 1957 speech, Mao accused the Soviet Union of “big-power chauvinism.” The following year, he complained to the Soviet ambassador in Beijing that “you think you are in a position to control us.” In Mao’s estimation, the Russians considered China “a backward nation.” Khrushchev, for his part, blamed Mao for the split. After Chinese and Indian troops exchanged fire across their contested border in 1959, Khrushchev commented that Beijing was “craving for war like a cock for a fight.” At at a gathering of party heads from the communist bloc, he derided Mao as “an ultra-leftist, an ultra-dogmatist.”\nThis rupture between the two leaders resulted in the unraveling of Chinese-Soviet collaboration. In 1960, the Soviets withdrew their military experts from China and broke off strategic cooperation. In the two years that followed, bilateral trade plummeted by some 40 percent. The border was remilitarized, and fighting that erupted in 1969 almost triggered a full-scale war. In the early 1970s, Nixon capitalized on and exacerbated the rift by reaching out to China, a process that culminated in the normalization of U.S.-Chinese relations in 1979. It would not be until after the collapse of the Soviet Union that relations between Moscow and Beijing would recover.\nFollowing the end of the Cold War, China and Russia began to patch things up. Over the course of the 1990s, the two countries resolved a number of remaining border disputes, and in 2001, they signed the Treaty of Good-Neighborliness and Friendly Cooperation. They gradually deepened military cooperation and trade ties, with the first oil pipeline from Russia to China completed in 2010. Beijing and Moscow also began to align their positions at the United Nations and collaborated on initiatives meant to counter Western influence, such as establishing the Shanghai Cooperation Organization in 2001 and the so-called BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa) economic grouping in 2009.\nThese incremental steps toward bilateral cooperation deepened and quickened under Xi and Putin, fueled by Moscow’s breach with the West following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the growing rivalry between the United States and China. In recent years, the relationship between China and Russia has begun to resemble the close Chinese-Soviet coupling of the 1950s. Building on the military cooperation that began in the 1990s, Russia has been helping China address its top defense priorities by providing jet fighters, state-of-the-art air defense systems, antiship missiles, and submarines. Some 70 percent of China’s arms imports have come from Russia in recent years. The sale of oil and gas to China buoys Russia’s economy and reduces China’s dependence on more vulnerable maritime supply routes. Russia now rivals Saudi Arabia as China’s top oil supplier, and China has replaced Germany as Russia’s top trading partner. Under Xi and Putin, China and Russia have teamed up to counter liberal norms in international bodies and propagate a brand of governance based on autocratic rule and state control of information platforms. In many parts of the world, Russian disinformation campaigns and intelligence operations are combining with the coercive leverage afforded by Chinese investment to support illiberal regimes.\nThis cooperation across multiple dimensions is impressive and consequential. But it rests on a fragile base and lacks a foundation of mutual trust—as did the Chinese-Soviet partnership of the early Cold War. In the 1950s, close ties between China and the Soviet Union were highly personalized, making them vulnerable to the vagaries of the relationship between Mao and Khrushchev. Today, Chinese-Russian cooperation depends heavily on the unpredictable relationship between two individuals, Xi and Putin. During the Cold War’s first decade, Moscow sought stability at home and abroad while Beijing favored continuous revolution. Today, Beijing banks on domestic and international stability to speed its rise, whereas Moscow flexes its muscles beyond its borders to foster disorder. During the 1950s, Moscow’s dominance of the partnership bred resentment in Beijing. Today, China enjoys the upper hand and stark power asymmetries rankle Russia.\nThe power gap is particularly hard for the Kremlin to swallow; looking like Xi’s sidekick does not play well at home for Putin, whose political brand rests on his bid to restore Russia to great-power status. But the disparity between the two countries is glaring and growing. Trade with China accounts for more than 15 percent of all of Russia’s foreign trade, whereas trade with Russia represents around one percent of China’s foreign commerce. And this imbalance is mounting as China’s high-tech sector advances. In Russia’s Far East, some six million Russians live across the border from roughly 110 million Chinese in the three provinces of Manchuria, and the region is becoming increasingly dependent on Chinese goods, services, and labor. Dmitri Trenin, a prominent Russian analyst, has gone so far as to speculate about a potential “Chinese takeover” of the region.\n\nIt has been a long time since the two countries have openly quarreled over territory and influence in the border regions. But nationalism and ethnocentrism run deep in both political cultures and could reignite long-standing territorial disputes. The South China Morning Post recently ran a commentary arguing that “Xi’s courtship of Moscow makes no sense because it ignores the animosity that has defined Sino-Russian relations since the . . . 17th century.” And anti-Chinese sentiment in Russia continues to get traction—stoked, as elsewhere, by COVID-19’s Chinese origins. But such biases long predate the pandemic, sustained in part by the same racial prejudices that Mao complained about six decades ago.\nRussia’s growing economic dependence on China leaves it increasingly exposed to Beijing’s coercive leverage and deepens Russia’s addiction to exporting fossil fuels, the sale of which represents over two-thirds of Russia’s export income and one-third of the federal budget. This hardly represents a good bet on the future as the world turns toward renewable sources of energy. China’s BRI is spreading investment and infrastructure across Eurasia, but the initiative mostly circumvents Russia, providing it few benefits. Only a handful of new border crossings have opened in recent years, and Chinese investment in Russia has been paltry.\nThe Russians envisage linking their own Eurasian Economic Union to the BRI, but the two systems compete with more than complement each other. In 2017, the EAEU proposed 40 transportation projects to China—and Beijing rejected all of them. Russia’s foreign minister was a no-show at a high-level meeting on the BRI last year, indicating, according to Ankur Shah, an analyst who focuses on Chinese-Russian relations, that Moscow “no longer feels obliged to bow before Beijing’s Belt and Road.” China has effectively replaced Russia as the dominant economic power in Central Asia, and Beijing’s interest in tapping into economic development and new shipping lanes in the high north—what China calls “the Arctic Silk Road”—poses a clear challenge to Russia’s strategy in the region. China’s plans for the Arctic ostensibly complement Russian ones, but as with the EAEU and the BRI, the competing visions stoke unease in Moscow.\nMeanwhile, the defense relationship between China and Russia has lost some of its earlier momentum. The Chinese military has benefited from transfers of Russian arms and weapons technology, and Moscow has welcomed the resulting revenue and military cooperation. Yet advances in China’s own defense industry—made possible in part by Chinese companies’ theft of Russian weapons technology—are making China less reliant on Russian imports. China’s acquisition of intermediate-range missiles (ostensibly intended to counter the United States’ forward presence) also poses a hypothetical threat to Russian territory. And Moscow is no doubt closely monitoring China’s expanding arsenal of intercontinental missiles and the construction of new launch silos in western China. Russia has aided and abetted China’s military modernization—perhaps at its own expense.\nIf Russia is to be drawn westward, it will result not from Washington’s overtures or altruism but from the Kremlin’s cold reassessment of how best to pursue its long-term self-interest. An offer from Washington to reduce tensions with the West will not succeed on its own; after all, Putin relies on such tensions to legitimate his iron political grip. Instead, the challenge facing Washington is to change the Kremlin’s broader strategic calculus by demonstrating that more cooperation with the West can help Russia redress the mounting vulnerabilities arising from its close partnership with China.\nWashington’s first step should be to drop its “democracy versus autocracy” framing of U.S. strategy. The United States and its ideological partners of course need to ensure that they can deliver for their citizens and outperform illiberal alternatives. But casting the contest in overtly ideological terms serves only to push Russia and China closer together. Instead, the Biden administration should have a candid discussion with Moscow about areas in which the long-term national interests of the United States and those of Russia overlap, including when it comes to China. To be sure, Russia and the United States remain at odds on many fronts. But rather than settling for continued estrangement, Washington should try to find common ground with Moscow on a wide range of issues, including strategic stability, cybersecurity, and climate change. This dialogue, even in the absence of rapid progress, would signal to Moscow that it has options other than alignment with China.\nThe Biden administration should press its democratic allies to have similar conversations with Russia; they, too, can probe areas of mutual interest and highlight how China’s growing strength comes at the expense of Russia’s influence and security. Given India’s long-standing ties to Russia and its skeptical view of Chinese intentions, New Delhi may be particularly adept at driving home to Moscow the merits of maintaining strategic autonomy and the potential perils of having too close a relationship with Beijing. To encourage India to help pull Russia away from China, Washington should waive sanctions that are currently pending against India for its purchase of Russia’s S-400 air defense system.\nThe United States and its allies should also help reduce Russia’s growing economic dependence on China. Although China is now Russia’s biggest single trading partner, Russia’s trade with the EU is far larger than its trade with China, representing almost 40 percent of Russia’s foreign commerce. Biden’s decision to effectively greenlight the controversial Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, which will carry Russian gas to Germany, was a wise investment in encouraging deeper trade links between Russia and Europe. And although Western sanctions against Russia were a necessary response to Moscow’s aggressive behavior, they have had the effect of pushing Russia further into China’s economic embrace. Accordingly, the United States and its partners should think twice before introducing new sanctions and should lay out a clear set of steps that Russia can take to persuade Washington to scale back existing ones, including committing to a diplomatic resolution to the conflict in eastern Ukraine and reining in Russia-based cyberattacks on U.S. networks.\n\nThe United States and its partners should also indicate that they are prepared to help Russia combat climate change and transition its economy away from its dependence on fossil fuels. In the near term, that task entails sharing best practices for capturing methane, assisting with the development of green alternatives to the production of oil and gas, and taking other steps to limit Russian emission of greenhouse gases. In the longer term, the United States should help Russia transition to a knowledge economy—a step that Putin has never taken, to the clear detriment of his country. China rarely shares technology; it is a taker, not a giver. The United States should seize the opportunity to share technological know-how with Russia to facilitate its transition to a greener, more diversified economy.\nThe United States should build on the conversation about strategic stability that Biden and Putin launched at their meeting in Geneva in June. Russia’s violation of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty prompted the United States to withdraw from it in 2019. The United States and Russia now need to find a solution to their own looming missile race and also push China to accept a follow-on agreement that would put limits on China’s large and diverse arsenal of intermediate-range missiles. Even if a tripartite pact proved unreachable, trying to negotiate one would likely illuminate fissures between Moscow and Beijing, given China’s traditional reluctance to enter into arms control agreements. Russia also has a vested interest in pulling China into a broader conversation with the United States about nonproliferation—one that addresses nuclear programs in Iran and North Korea, where U.S. and Russian interests overlap.\nThe Arctic is another area where Washington can help Moscow see the strategic downsides of abetting Beijing’s growing ambitions. Climate change is dramatically increasing the accessibility of the high north, prompting new Russian interest in the region’s economic and strategic importance and stirring Russian discomfort with China’s declaration that it is a “near-Arctic power.” Washington and Moscow hardly see eye-to-eye on the region, but through both the Arctic Council and bilateral dialogue, they should develop a more robust set of rules of the road governing economic and military activity in the Arctic and addressing their mutual concerns about Chinese designs.\nFinally, Washington should encourage Moscow to help check China’s growing influence in developing areas, including Central Asia, the broader Middle East, and Africa. In most regions, Russian policy regularly runs counter to U.S. interests; Moscow still sees Washington as its main competitor. Yet as Beijing continues to extend its economic and strategic reach, Moscow will come to see that it is China, not the United States, that regularly undercuts Russian influence in many of these areas. Washington should make that case, helping bring Russian and U.S. interests into greater alignment and creating opportunities for coordinating regional strategy.\nGiven the antagonism and mistrust that currently plague relations between Russia and the United States, it will take time and purposeful diplomacy for Washington to change Moscow’s strategic calculus. Russia may well stick with its current course—perhaps until Putin eventually leaves office. But in light of the impressive pace and scope of China’s geopolitical ascent, now is the time to begin sowing the seeds of a Chinese-Russian split, especially among the younger cadre of Russian officials and thinkers who will take the reins after Putin departs the scene.\nU.S. efforts to manage China’s rise successfully and peacefully will be significantly advanced if China faces strategic pressure on more than its maritime flank and can no longer count on Russia’s steady military and diplomatic support. Currently, China is able to focus on expansion in the western Pacific and farther afield in part because it has a relatively free hand along its continental borders and enjoys Moscow’s backing. The United States would be wise to invest in a long-term strategy to change that equation by helping put China’s relationship with Russia back into play. Doing so would be an important step toward building a pluralistic multipolar order and heading off Beijing’s potential efforts to construct a Sinocentric international system.\nCHARLES A.

  "Russia's 'Foreign Agent' Law Targets Journalists, Activists, Even Ordinary Citizens\n\n\n      Lucian Kim\n    \n\n\n                Roman Dobrokhotov, chief editor of The Insider, walks surrounded by police and journalists, in Moscow on Wednesday.

Police raided his home after the investigative news organization was designated as a \"foreign agent.\" Last week, it became the 16th media outlet to be added to the Russian Justice Ministry's foreign agents list.\nMOSCOW — Darya Apakhonchich never considered herself a foreign agent.\nShe taught Russian to refugees in her hometown, St. Petersburg, and took part in street performances against militarism and violence against women. The activism of Apakhonchich's art group was quirky and local, and their performances typically got a couple of hundred views on YouTube.\n\"It's not a crime to teach Russian as a foreign language and get paid for it,\" Apakhonchich says. \"And it's not a crime to be engaged in activism and go to demonstrations, especially in view of the Russian constitution.\"\nBut the Russian authorities have treated her as if she were a criminal.\nIn December, the 36-year-old mother of two discovered that the Justice Ministry had included her in a list of \"foreign media agents,\" alongside media outlets including U.S. government-funded Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. Apakhonchich's offenses were getting paid by organizations such as the French College at St. Petersburg State University and posting her political views on social media.\nA month after finding herself on the list, Apakhonchich says, police sawed open her front door early one Sunday morning, confiscated her family's electronic devices and spent seven hours searching their apartment for \"extremist\" material.\n\n                A self-portrait of Darya Apakhonchich, with the writing on her face and a figure of a woman saying: \"Not only a body but a person, person, person, person, person.\" She made the photo in support of Russian artist and LGBTQ activist Yulia Tsvetkova, who faces criminal charges for spreading pornography through her art.\n                \n                \n                    \n                    Darya Apakhonchich\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n\nA self-portrait of Darya Apakhonchich, with the writing on her face and a figure of a woman saying: \"Not only a body but a person, person, person, person, person.\" She made the photo in support of Russian artist and LGBTQ activist Yulia Tsvetkova, who faces criminal charges for spreading pornography through her art.\nRussia's 2012 law on foreign agents originally singled out nongovernmental organizations receiving grants from abroad. The legislation has since been amended to target not only media organizations but also individual journalists, YouTube bloggers and practically anyone else who receives money from abroad and voices a political opinion.\nUpon receiving the designation, they are required to label anything they publish — even social media posts — as the work of a foreign agent, and submit quarterly financial reports to the Justice Ministry. Bookkeeping mistakes and failure to comply can result in fines and even imprisonment.\nAt the end of last year, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed new legislation that expanded the legal definition of who can be considered a foreign agent. Since December, the Justice Ministry has slapped the label on more than a dozen Russian citizens, including Apakhonchich and Lev Ponomaryov, a human rights activist for more than 30 years.\nFollowing the imprisonment of opposition leader Alexei Navalny earlier this year, the Kremlin has used the foreign agents law to go after journalists and news organizations that are critical of the government. Last week, the investigative news site The Insider became the 16th media outlet to be added to the Justice Ministry's foreign agents list.\nVTimes, an independent business news site, closed in June, saying its designation as a foreign agent had destroyed its business model. Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty faces more than $3 million in fines for refusing to label its content as being produced by a \"foreign agent.\"\nMeduza, a popular independent news site, has struggled after being labeled a foreign agent and appearing on the Justice Ministry's blacklist in April. In 2014, dissident Russian journalists founded the site in neighboring Latvia to shield it from Kremlin pressure. Meduza later branched out into podcasts and an English-language version.\n\"It's harder to talk to people now because a lot of people who would gladly speak to us are now wary of being associated with a 'foreign agent,' which is a huge impediment,\" says Alexey Kovalyov, Meduza's investigations editor.\nAfter the designation turned Meduza into a \"toxic brand,\" Kovalyov says, advertisers fled. A crowdfunding drive has brought in donations from 96,000 contributors, holding the site afloat at least for a few more months.\n\"What happens after that, no one knows really, because we don't know how sustainable this crowdfunding model is,\" Kovalyov says.\nThe Kremlin denies that the foreign agents legislation is censorship, and Putin often compares it to the U.S. law on foreign agents. On paper, the laws may be similar, but human rights groups say the Russian authorities use the \"foreign agent\" designation as a way of stifling dissent.\n\"Since 2012, the Russian government has used the 'foreign agents' law to demonize independent groups that accept foreign funding and carry out public advocacy, especially those that in any way challenge government policies and actions,\" Human Rights Watch said in November. \"In Russia, the term 'foreign agent' has a strong negative connotation, akin to 'traitor.'\"\nWhen the Russian law came up in a meeting of the Kremlin's human rights council in December, Putin recalled the case of Maria Butina, a Russian citizen who spent more than a year in U.S. detention after being charged with acting as an unregistered foreign agent. Putin told the council that it was necessary for Russia to designate individuals as foreign agents because \"some people are simply inventing new ways of getting money from abroad for their activities.\"\nPutin told NBC News in June that many organizations of \"so-called civil society\" are financed and receive training from abroad. \"To prevent this kind of interference in our domestic affairs, we make relevant decisions and adopt relevant laws,\" he said.\nFor the Russian authorities, Putin's hard line is a green light to crack down on civil society.\n\"The way they perceive civil society is: 'He who pays the piper, calls the tune,'\" says Maxim Trudolyubov, a contributing editor to Meduza and a senior adviser to the Kennan Institute at the Woodrow Wilson Center in Washington, D.C. \"They decided for the public that the reason for anything that goes wrong comes from the West, from abroad.\"\nTrudolyubov says Putin needs to manufacture threats to keep his grip on power. But the \"totalitarian instinct\" behind the Kremlin's foreign agent law, he says, clashes with the complex, diverse society that Russia has become.\n\"Putin himself is part of a generation that remembers the Soviet Union very well, and he wants to be in control,\" says Trudolyubov. \"He is very nervous to see he cannot achieve that kind of control and that there are parts of society that reject him.\"\nApakhonchich, the activist and teacher, represents a new generation of Russians. After the police raid on her home, she moved with her children to neighboring Georgia for the family's safety. She says that her designation as a foreign media agent was designed to send a signal.\n\"I believe that I was chosen to intimidate people who, like me, cooperate with foreign organizations,\" she says.\nIn May, a St. Petersburg court upheld her blacklisting. But Apakhonchich refuses to be silent.\n\"Maybe I could have gone back to just being a mom,\" she says. \"But I understand that people still face repressions even if they say nothing, don't give interviews and hope that by sitting quietly, everything will be all right.\"\nNPR thanks our sponsors\nBecome an NPR sponsor",
  "Opinion | Russia’s New Form of Organized Crime Is Menacing the World - The New York Times",
  "Advertisement\nSupported by\nThe Editorial Board\nRussia’s New Form of Organized Crime Is Menacing the World\nBy The Editorial Board\nThe editorial board is a group of opinion journalists whose views are informed by expertise, research, debate and certain longstanding values. It is separate from the newsroom.\nThe screen goes blank.\nA message appears in crude, Google Translate English, advising that all your files have been encrypted — rendered unusable — and can be restored only if you pay a ransom.\nAfter some back and forth, you pay out in Bitcoin or some other cryptocurrency, most likely to a Russian-based gang. There’s no choice: It’s cheaper and far quicker to pay up than to rebuild a computer system from scratch. To avoid further trouble or embarrassment, many victims don’t even notify the police.\nA few years ago, the ransom may have been a few hundred bucks. In early May, Colonial Pipeline shelled out $5 million to the DarkSide ransomware gang to get oil flowing through its pipes again. (Some was recovered by the Justice Department.) In June, the meat processor JBS paid $11 million to the Russian-based REvil (Ransomware Evil) gang. About a month ago REvil came back to score what may be the biggest attack yet, freezing the systems of about a thousand companies after hacking an IT service provider they all used. The ask this time was $70 million. The criminals behind ransomware have also evolved, expanding from lone sharks to a business in which tasks are farmed out to groups of criminals specializing in hacking, collecting ransom or marshaling armies of bots.Ransomware attacks can cripple critical infrastructure like hospitals and schools and even core functions of major cities. Using methods as simple as spoof emails, hackers can take over entire computer systems and pilfer personal data and passwords and then demand a ransom to restore access.\nIn about a dozen years, ransomware has emerged as a major cyberproblem of our time, big enough for President Biden to put it at the top of his agenda with Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, when they met in June and for lawmakers in Congress to be working on several bills that would, among other things, require victims to report attacks to the government.\nIt is a war that needs to be fought, and won. While the extortion business is run by a relatively small network of criminals seeking windfall profits, their ability to seriously disrupt economies and to breach strategically critical enterprises or agencies also makes them a formidable potential threat to national security. The Colonial Pipeline attack created an almost instant shortage of fuel and spread panic in the southeastern United States.\nBig strikes make the big news, but the main prey of the ransomware gangs is the small to medium enterprise or institution that is devastated by the disruption of its computers and the ransom payment. How many have been hit is anybody’s guess — unlike breaches of personal information, the law does not require most ransomware attacks to be reported (though that is another thing Congress may soon change).\nThe F.B.I. internet Crime Report for 2020 listed 2,474 attacks in the United States, with losses totaling more than $29.1 million. The reality is probably of a different magnitude. The German data-crunching firm Statista has estimated that there were 304 million attacks worldwide in 2020, a 62 percent increase over 2019. Most of them, Statista said, were in the professional sector — lawyers, accountants, consultants and the like.\nWhatever the true scope, the problem will not be solved with patches, antivirus software or two-factor authentication, though security experts stress that every bit of protection helps. “We’re not going to defend ourselves out of this problem,” said Dmitri Alperovitch, the chairman of Silverado Policy Accelerator and a leading authority on ransomware. “We have too many vulnerabilities. Companies that are small, libraries, fire departments will never afford the required security technology and talent.”\nThe battle must be joined elsewhere, and the place to start is Russia. That, according to the experts, is where the majority of attacks originate. Three other countries — China, Iran and North Korea — are also serious players, and the obvious commonality is that all are autocracies whose security apparatuses doubtlessly know full well who the hackers are and could shut them down in a minute. So the presumption is that the criminals are protected, either through bribes — which, given their apparent profits, they can distribute lavishly — or by doing pro bono work for the government or both.\nIt’s clear that the ransomware gangs take care not to target the powers that shelter them. Security analysts found that REvil code was written so that the malware avoids any computer whose default language is Russian, Ukrainian, Belarusian, Tajik, Armenian, Azerbaijani, Georgian, Kazakh, Kyrgyz, Turkmen, Uzbek, Tatar, Romanian or Syriac.\nFinding the criminals is not the problem. The U.S. government has the wherewithal to identify and arrest would-be cyberblackmailers on its own soil and to help allies find them on theirs. In fact, Washington has identified and indicted many Russian cybercriminals — the F.B.I., for example, has offered a reward of $3 million for information leading to the arrest of one Evgeniy Bogachev, a.k.a. “lucky12345,” a master hacker in southern Russia whose malware has led to financial losses of more than $100 million.\nThe key is to compel Mr. Putin to act against them. At his summit with him in June, Mr. Biden said he demanded that Russia take down the ransomware gangs it harbors and identified 16 critical sectors of the American economy on which attacks would provoke a response.\nYet two weeks later, REvil made the biggest strike ever, hacking into Kaseya, a firm that supplies management software for the I.T. industry, and attacking hundreds of its small-business customers. That led Mr. Biden to telephone Mr. Putin and to say afterward that “we expect them to act.” Asked by a reporter whether he would take down REvil’s servers if Mr. Putin did not, Mr. Biden simply said, “Yes.” Shortly after that, REvil abruptly disappeared from the dark web.\nTempting as it might be to believe that Mr. Biden persuaded the Russians to act or knocked the band’s servers out with American means, it is equally possible that REvil went dark on its own, intending, as happens so often in its shadowy world, to reappear later in other guises.\nSo long as the hackers focus on commercial blackmail abroad, Mr. Putin probably sees no reason to shut them down. They do not harm him or his friends, and they can be used by his spooks when necessary. Unlike the “official” hackers working for military intelligence who have drawn sanctions from Washington and Europe for meddling in elections or mucking around in government systems, Mr. Putin can deny any responsibility for what the criminal gangs do. “It’s just nonsense. It’s funny,” he said in June when asked about Russia’s role in ransomware attacks. “It’s absurd to accuse Russia of this.”\nThe Russians apparently also believe they can parlay their control over the ransomware gangs into negotiating leverage with the West. Sergei Rybakov, the deputy foreign minister who leads the Russian side in strategic stability talks launched at the Biden-Putin summit, indicated as much when he complained recently that the United States was focusing on ransomware separately from other security issues. Ransomware, he implied, was part of a bigger pile of bargaining chips.\nThat, said Mr. Alperovitch, suggests that Mr. Putin does not appreciate how seriously the new American president takes ransomware. For reasons still unclear, Donald Trump as president was prepared to give Mr. Putin carte blanche for any cybermischief. Mr. Biden, by contrast, sees himself as the champion of small business and the middle class, and it is there that ransomware hurts the most.\nWriting in The Washington Post, Mr. Alperovitch and Matthew Rojansky, an expert on Russia who heads the Kennan Institute at the Wilson Center, argued that Mr. Biden should confront Mr. Putin with a clear message: Crack down or else. If the Russians do not, the authors wrote, the Biden administration “could hit Russia where it hurts by sanctioning its largest gas and oil companies, which are responsible for a significant portion of the Russian government’s revenue.”\nDrawing red lines for Russia does not usually work. The message would best be delivered privately, so that Mr. Putin would not be challenged to publicly back down before the United States. It is possible that Mr. Biden has already delivered such a message. If so, he should be prepared to follow through.\nThe other critical factor in ransomware is cryptocurrency. By no coincidence, there were few ransomware attacks before Bitcoin came into being a dozen years ago. Now, cybercriminals can be paid off in a currency that’s hard to track or recover, though the U.S. government managed to do just that when it recouped $2.3 million of the Colonial Pipeline stash.\nCryptocurrency is reportedly one of the issues addressed in legislation soon to be introduced by the Senate Homeland Security Committee. Congress is also being urged by federal law enforcement agencies to pass a law compelling companies in critical industry sectors hit by a cyberattack to inform the government, and a host of other anti-ransomware bills is in the works.\nMounting a multifront attack against ransomware will take time and effort. Devising ways to control cryptocurrency is bound to be complex and fraught. Companies will be reluctant to damage their brand by acknowledging that they have been hacked or have paid ransom, and lawmakers have been traditionally wary of passing laws that impose burdens on businesses.\nBut letting Russian hackers continue to wreak havoc on America’s and the world’s digital infrastructure with impunity is an immediate and critical challenge. If this is not stopped soon, further escalation — and the growth of organized cybercrime syndicates in other dictatorships — is all but certain.\nMr. Putin must be made to understand that this is not about geopolitics or strategic relations but about a new and menacing form of organized crime. That is something every government should seek to crush. If he refuses, Mr. Putin should know that he will be regarded as an accomplice and be punished as such.\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

  "\n                    Russia must end Armenian military presence at border: Azerbaijan\n                \nRussia must put an end to the illegal presence of Armenian troops within Azerbaijan's borders, Baku urged Moscow on Wednesday as Russia vowed to help modernize and re-equip Yerevan’s army.\nIn a statement, Azerbaijan's Defense Ministry said Russian peacekeeping troops temporarily deployed in Azerbaijan should take action against the presence of Armenian forces in the country under a trilateral agreement inked last year.\nThe ministry accused Armenian forces of moving into Azerbaijani territory and building outposts, actions prohibited under the Nov. 10, 2020 treaty.\nThese new posts are being set up \"near Mukhtarkend and Shushakend, as well as in the territories to the east of the administrative boundaries of the Kalbajar and Lachin regions,\" it added.\nNoting that Azerbaijani military forces had taken the necessary measures to prevent such behavior, it said that Yerevan seeks to escalate tension between the two countries.\n\nIt further argued that a recent order by Armenia's new Defense Minister Arshak Karapetyan for the Armenian military to \"use force by any means\" was \"irresponsible and provocative.\"\nMeanwhile, Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu stated on the same day that Russia will help re-equip and modernize the Armenian Armed Forces, praising Yerevan as \"Russia's ally and a key partner in the Caucasus region.”\nShoigu promised further support to the country as he greeted his Armenian counterpart, Karapetyan, at a meeting in Moscow.\n\"We attach great importance to the development of our cooperation in the military field, both in the bilateral format and within the framework of the CSTO (Collective Security Treaty Organization). At the same time, we are ready to continue to assist in the implementation of the program for the reform and re-equipment of the Armenian Armed Forces. The task is not easy, but I think that with your experience you can handle it,\" he said.\nKarapetyan expressed gratitude to Shoigu for his readiness to help restore the combat capabilities of his armed forces.\nHe stressed that his first international visit as defense minister is to Russia.\n\"Russia is the only state that provides really tangible security for the Armenian people and today deals with security issues not only in Nagorno-Karabakh but also directly on the borders of Armenia. We are ready for very close and effective cooperation,\" he said.\nArmenia had previously requested Russian military support. Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinian last month proposed that Russian border forces be stationed along the length of its border with Azerbaijan amid rising tensions between Yerevan and Baku, the TASS news agency reported.\nRelations between the two former Soviet republics have been tense since 1991 when the Armenian military occupied Nagorno-Karabakh, a territory internationally recognized as part of Azerbaijan, and seven adjacent regions.\nNew clashes erupted in September last year and ended on Nov. 10 with a Russia-brokered cease-fire.\nDuring the 44-day conflict, Azerbaijan liberated several cities and nearly 300 settlements and villages from Armenia's nearly three-decade occupation.\nThe cease-fire is seen as a victory for Azerbaijan and a defeat for Armenia, whose armed forces withdrew in line with the agreement.\nA joint Turkish-Russian center was established to monitor the truce. Russian peacekeeping troops have also been deployed in the region.\n \n\n\n                    Please\n                     click \n                    to read our informative text prepared pursuant to the Law on the Protection of Personal Data No. 6698 and to get information about the\n                    cookies\n                    used on our website in accordance with the relevant legislation.\n                \n\n\n 6698 sayılı Kişisel Verilerin Korunması Kanunu uyarınca hazırlanmış aydınlatma metnimizi okumak ve sitemizde ilgili mevzuata uygun olarak kullanılan\n                    çerezlerle\n                    ilgili bilgi almak için lütfen\n                    tıklayınız. \n\n",

  "Russia’s senior lawmaker says Baku’s former envoy should apologize for insulting Russians\n\n\nMOSCOW, August 11. /TASS/. Azerbaijan’s former Ambassador to Belarus, Moldova and Pakistan Isfandiyar Vahabzadeh should apologize for his remarks about Russians as an ethnic group, otherwise, he and everyone else who allow such comments will face consequences, Deputy Speaker of the Russian State Duma (lower house of parliament) Pyotr Tolstoy wrote in his Telegram channel on Wednesday.\nHe noted, \"even if the diplomat is a former one, he understands perfectly well what is and what is not acceptable.\"\nAccording to the lawmaker, \"neither he [Vahabzadeh] nor those in national republics, which became young but not independent states at Russia’s good will, who insult Russia and Russians are scared of consequences.\"\n\"While there will be consequences. Or there should be apologies. One person can forgive another. However, insulting people, religion and state remain in history between states,\" Tolstoy concluded.\nEarlier, a video address by Vahabzadeh emerged online where he delivered brazen insults against Russians as an ethnic group and specifically leader of the Russian Liberal Democratic Party Vladimir Zhirinovsky. Zhirinovsky later said that he would seek a criminal case against the former envoy. The Azerbaijani Foreign Ministry informed that the former ambassador is currently not speaking on behalf of any state institutions, he \"was released from his position of ambassador in 2016 for poor performance.\".",
  "Russia’s Robot Fighter Apparently Isn’t Very Robotic",
  "Russia’s Robot Fighter Apparently Isn’t Very Robotic\nRussian defense minister Sergei Shoigu visits the S-70 production line.\nIn the race to develop robotic fighter jets, it might look like Russia is pulling ahead of the United States. \nBut appearances can be deceiving. Russia’s first few robot fighters ... probably won’t be very robotic.\nThe Russian and U.S. Air Forces both are developing fast, armed unmanned aerial vehicles that, in theory, would accompany manned fighters into combat, adding their sensors and weapons to a fast-moving battle.\nBut these so-called “wingman” drones require a high degree of autonomy in order to keep up. And while Russia quickly is moving to build its S-70 Okhotnik wingman drone, it’s not making a lot of obvious progress on the autonomy that could make the type a viable combatant.\n“It’s likely that the first batch of S-70s will be either directed from the ground or from Su-57 aircraft, so that the Okhotnik will be a remote-controlled vehicle, initially,” said Samuel Bendett, an analyst with the Center for a New American Security in Washington, D.C. and the Center for Naval Analysis in Virginia.\nBendett co-wrote a recent study on Russian robotics.\nRussian defense minister Sergei Shoigu caused a minor stir last week when he dropped by Sukhoi’s Novosibirsk Aviation Plant in Siberia to inspect the S-70 assembly line.\nThe jet-propelled Okhotnik flew for the first time in August 2019. A subsonic flying-wing with some stealth qualities, the S-70 is in roughly the performance class as the Valkyrie wingman drone the U.S. Air Force is developing as part of its Skyborg initiative. \nThe idea is for self-guiding S-70s eventually to fly alongside manned Su-57 stealth fighters. But that demands sophisticated artificial intelligence. Where the U.S. Air Force as part of its Skyborg effort is focusing on developing the A.I., the Russians appear to be focusing on the airframe.\nSeveral S-70s are under construction at the Novosibirsk Aviation Plant. Some time next year, they could join the single Okhotnik that’s already undergoing flight testing. \n“We hope that by 2022 the work will be completed and we will be able to sign ... a large, long-term contract,” Shoigu said. \nThe Americans meanwhile don’t have firm plans to transition Skyborg to a production program. The A.I. isn’t ready. \nThe Russians for their part don’t seem to mind pushing ahead without full autonomy. The Kremlin “claims that Okhotnik will have A.I., but offers little detail beyond such statements,” Bendett said. \n“Presumably, the [defense ministry] is working on different types of algorithms that would allow S-70 to fly, navigate and possibly engage targets on its own after the human operator would approve flight patterns and target-selection and -recognition,” Bendett added.\nBut that’s all just conjecture. The American Skyborg already has begun rigorous autonomy trials. But the Russian wingman drone apparently still relies on a human operator who directly controls it. \nAutonomy isn’t the S-70’s only problem. The drone with its 46-foot wingspan is a big UAV. And that translates into high cost that in turn limits how fast the Kremlin can acquire the type. \nA single S-70 could cost up to $20 million, according to Bendett. Compare that the American Valkyrie with its 22-foot wingspan: It costs just $2 million. The U.S. Air Force all along has said that wingman drones should be “attritable” — that is, expendable in combat. \nOkhotnik does not appear to be economically attritable. “This is an expensive aircraft and it would take a while for the Russian MOD to scale up its production, and to get to the point where this drone can truly fly on its own in future combat,” Bendett said.\n\nI'm a journalist, author and filmmaker based in Columbia, South Carolina.",
  "Russia Scoffs at Tokyo Olympics Ban: ‘Let Them Listen to Classical Music’ - The New York Times",
  "Advertisement\nSupported by\nRussia Scoffs at Olympic Ban: ‘Let Them Listen to Classical Music’\nSports fans and officials in the country have no trouble seeing through the thin fiction of a doping-related ban on their national symbols at the Tokyo Olympics.\nBy Andrew E. Kramer\nMOSCOW — Russia’s Olympic team is competing abroad in unmarked uniforms without the country’s flag — not unlike the Russian Army on its unacknowledged military incursions, as one joke making the rounds in Moscow notes.\nWhen a Russian wins a gold medal and takes the top spot on the podium, the country’s national anthem doesn’t play. Instead, a portion of Tchaikovsky’s Piano Concerto No. 1 celebrates the winner.\n“Let them listen to classical music,” Russia’s Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, Maria Zakharova, said in a video the ministry released to cheer on the not-exactly-Russian team.\nWith humor and pride, Russians are gloating over their athletes’ many medals this summer despite a prohibition on national symbols at the Tokyo Summer Olympics — a punishment for egregious past doping infractions.\n“Will this stop our guys?” Tina Kandelaki, a social media influencer, wrote on Instagram. “No. The Olympics become one of those situations when you want to prove and show to everybody that you are Russian.”\nIndeed, sports fans and sports commentators are having no trouble seeing through the thin fiction of the odd, bureaucratic moniker of their team — R.O.C., an acronym for the Russian Olympic Committee.\n“Nobody is bothered at all by this situation,” Dmitri Kozika, a bartender at Probka, a sports bar, said of Russian sports fans.\nThrough the warm twilight of a recent summer evening in Moscow, fans sat at leather-upholstered bar stools, sipped beers and kept an eye on replays from Tokyo. When Russians rack up gold, which happens often enough at any Olympics, the patrons cheer, Mr. Kozika said.\nIf anything, he said, the extra scrutiny of their team, which had to pass a rigorous drug clearance program, has given Russian sports fans a restored sense of pride in the victories that followed. “They checked our guys really thoroughly,” Mr. Kozika said. “They are clean.”\nRoman Pritula, an ambulance medic taking a well-deserved break at the bar from Covid-19 duty, similarly shrugged off the Russian team’s strange name.\n“It doesn’t prevent us from being proud,” he said. “It doesn’t matter if they compete under the Olympic flag. They are still Russians. And when they win, it causes positive emotions.”\nAnd even officials who once complained bitterly about the doping restrictions have taken to lightly poking fun at what was meant to be a humbling state of affairs.\nThe Foreign Ministry video, for example, ended with the thumping drums of the rock song by Queen “We Will Rock You” — which is rendered in writing, of course, as “We Will R.O.C. You.”\nThe commanding victory over the United States in women’s team gymnastics, the head of Russia’s Olympic Committee, Stanislav Pozdnyakov, said proudly, will inspire a new generation of young Russian girls to become gymnasts.\nThe Russians Lilia Akhaimova, Viktoria Listunova, Angelina Melnikova and Vladislava Urazova won gold medals after the American star Simone Biles pulled out of the competition, saying she had become dangerously disoriented during a vault and wasn’t mentally prepared to continue.\n“Honestly, I’m full of emotion,” Mr. Pozdnyakov told the Tass news agency. “It’s been a long time since we dominated like this in gymnastics. It’s really important in team disciplines, as it inspires and fills with spirit the other teams and motivates the young.”\nThe sports commentator for state Channel 1, Dmitry Guberniyev, was so inspired by the Russian — sorry, R.O.C. — victory that he suggested declaring a national holiday.\n“We just need a Russia-wide celebration,” he said. “The team was just unbelievable. We are creating miracles.”\nLidiya Ivanova, a commentator on Match TV, a Russian sports channel, couldn’t curb her enthusiasm as the Russian female gymnasts won the gold.\n“What are you achieving, our girls! You are the best because you are Russians! You defended the honor of the country,” she said. “I adore you. Everybody adores you.”\nAnd Russians have more to look forward to from the R.O.C.: Some events that Russian female athletes have historically dominated with crushing mastery, including artistic swimming and rhythmic gymnastics, lie ahead.\nRussians have pointed with pride to the actions of a female fencer, Marta Martyanova, whatever the name of her team.\nMs. Martyanova refused to bow out despite a leg trauma painful enough to leave her crying and hopping on one foot. At that point no substitutes were allowed in the team competition, and withdrawal would have cost the Russians a shot at a medal, so her stoic endurance saved the day. Russia’s team went on to win the gold.\n“A true young woman hero,” the Kremlin spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, said.\nThe doping restrictions have hung over Russian sports for years, to the point Russian sports fans no longer pay attention, Aleksei Durnovo, a commentator for Telesport, said in an interview.\n“They just want to watch sports, not think about what is happening in medical laboratories,” he said.\nThe roots of the restrictions lie in one of the worst cheating scandals in sports history: During the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi there was a campaign by coaches, athletes and the Russian security services to swap contaminated urine samples for clean ones.\nThe violations eventually came to involve more than 1,000 athletes, coaches and sports officials in Russia and led to blanket bans on Russia’s competing in international sports, including the Olympics.\nRussia spent years trying to overturn the bans and in December won a partial victory in the Court of Arbitration for Sport, which cleared the way for 330 Russians to compete in Tokyo, though not in national uniform, over the objections of antidoping officials.\nMany Russians are just happy to see their gymnasts, swimmers, equestrians, archers and other athletes have a shot at medals. But on a darker note, beating the doping restrictions for some Russians also became something to cheer for this summer.\nRussian propaganda and even some of the team members have been thumbing their noses at the doping regulators’ flimsy form of punishment.\nA wall mural in Moscow, for example, shows a martial arts practitioner in a kimono sporting a bear emblem flipping a competitor in a kimono with the insignia of WADA, the World Anti-Doping Agency.\nThe Russian artistic swimming team tried to compete in bear-themed swimsuits, only to have that plan vetoed by Olympic officials for the obvious reference to a Russian national symbol.\nA team member, Alla Shishkina, complained bitterly, RT reported. “This annoyed us,” she said. “Bears live in many countries, not only in Russia. This could have been any bear! A grizzly, a panda, anything. But they banned it just for our country.”\nBut she added, “We just got a little upset in the changing room, that was all. The most important thing is to perform well.”\nOleg Matsnev contributed reporting.\nAdvertisement",
  "Russia’s baffling quest to create its own domestic internet. ",
  "Russia’s Nonsensical, Impossible Quest to Create Its Own Domestic Internet\n\n    \n        This article is part of the Free Speech Project, a collaboration between Future Tense and the Tech, Law, & Security Program at American University Washington College of Law that examines the ways technology is influencing how we think about speech.\n      \n  \nAs a general rule, when a country shuts off some or all of its connections to the global internet, it doesn’t need to announce the news. People in that country notice when they can’t access online services, and people outside that country can quickly figure out that something’s going on when they stop receiving traffic from that country or being able to route traffic to servers and service providers in that country. So it was pretty strange when Russia decided to announce last week that it had successfully run tests between June 15 and July 15 to show it could disconnect itself from the internet.\nThe tests seem to have gone largely unnoticed both in and outside of Russia, indicating that whatever they entailed they did not involve Russia actually disconnecting from the global internet. Indeed, it’s a little difficult to guess at what exactly the tests did involve given the vagueness of a report in the RBC Daily. The Russian newspaper published an article on July 21 reporting that the month of tests had been a success, citing documents from an information security working group that indicated all of the major telecom providers in Russia had participated in the tests. The exercises are supposed to be held annually but were canceled last year due to the pandemic, and whatever went on this year definitely did not include Russia disconnecting from the global internet for any prolonged period of time since that would be impossible to hide. Instead, the tests—and, most of all, the announcement about their success—seem to be intended as some kind of signal that Russia is no longer dependent on the rest of the world for its internet access. But it’s not at all clear what that would even mean since Russia is clearly still dependent on people and companies in other countries for access to the online content and services they create and host—just as we all are.\nFor the past two years, ever since implementing its “sovereign internet law” in 2019, Russia has been talking about establishing its own domestic internet that does not rely on any infrastructure or resources located outside the country. Presumably, the tests completed this summer are related to that goal of being able to operate a local internet within Russia that does not rely on the global Domain Name System to map websites to specific IP addresses. This is not actually a particularly ambitious goal—any country could operate its own domestic internet with its own local addressing system if it wanted to do so instead of connecting to the larger global internet (the one I would call the “Internet” if I were still permitted by style guides to use a capital “I” in that word—and, this is exactly why Internet is grammatically important: to distinguish between smaller, local internetworks, or internets, like Russia’s and the global, public Internet you are using to read this article).\nThe confusing thing about Russia’s plans is it seems to want to be able to use its isolated Russian internet to access the global internet. So, by design, the tests of Russia’s sovereign internet did not cause any interruption to its connection to the global internet—but it’s completely unclear what they actually did. One source apparently told the Russian newspaper RBC Daily that “the capability of physically disconnecting the Russian part of the internet was tested.” But there’s simply no way that Russia could have physically disconnected its infrastructure from the rest of the world for any extended period of time without anyone noticing.\nThe Center for Applied Internet Data Analysis at the University of California San Diego maintains an Internet Outage Detection and Analysis tool that combines three data sets to identify internet outages around the world. It monitors the Border Gateway Protocol that is used by internet service providers to exchange routing information, as well as what IP addresses it is receiving traffic from, and which addresses it is able to probe, to figure out when parts of the internet become unreachable or go offline. When there is an actual internet outage, typically one or more of these indicators drops significantly because the region stops exchanging routing information with outside providers, stops sending outbound traffic, or stops receiving inbound traffic. The data sets for Russia from June 15 through July 15, the period of the supposed disconnection tests, shows few indications of any actual disconnection other than a period around July 5 when unsolicited traffic from Russia appears to have dropped off.\nWhatever Russia did this summer, it did not physically disconnect from the global internet. It doesn’t even appear to have virtually disconnected from the global internet in any meaningful sense. Perhaps it shifted some of its critical infrastructure systems to rely more on domestic service providers and resources. Perhaps it created more local copies of the addressing system used to navigate the internet and tested its ability to rely on those. Perhaps it tested its ability to route online traffic within the country through certain chokepoints for purposes of better surveillance and monitoring. None of those are activities that would be immediately visible from outside the country and all of them would be in line with Russia’s stated goals of relying less on internet infrastructure outside its borders and strengthening its ability to monitor online activity.\n\n        Popular in\n        \n          Technology\n        \n\nBut the goal of being completely independent of the rest of the world’s internet infrastructure while still being able to access the global internet is a nonsensical and impossible one. Russia cannot both disconnect from the internet and still be able to use all of the online services and access all of the websites hosted and maintained by people in other parts of the world, as appears to have been the case during the monthlong period of testing. So it’s a little hard to know what to make of last week’s reports about the successful tests of the Russian domestic internet. If the announcement is meant as public posturing, it’s not clear what message, exactly, it’s intended to send. Being able to disconnect your country from the internet is not all that difficult—and certainly nothing to brag about. But announcing that you’ve successfully disconnected from the internet when it’s patently clear that you haven’t suggests both profound technical incompetence and a deep-seated uncertainty about what a domestic Russian internet would actually mean.\n\nFuture Tense\n  is a partnership of\n  Slate,\n  New America, and\n  Arizona State  University\n  that examines emerging technologies, public policy, and society.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\nAll contents © 2021 The Slate Group LLC.

  "Navalny: Putin’s Nemesis, Russia’s Future? review – slick, slippery and brave | Biography books | The Guardian",
  "Navalny: Putin’s Nemesis, Russia’s Future? review – slick, slippery and brave\nAn engaging academic study of Alexei Navalny paints a vivid picture of a Russian politician who is a necessarily courageous product of the internet age\nIn January, Alexei Navalny boarded a flight to Moscow. Russia’s most famous dissident had spent five months in Germany recovering from the effects of novichok poisoning. Surrounded by journalists who travelled with him, he was under no illusions as to what would happen once he swapped Berlin for home.\nThe Russian authorities would arrest him, for sure. He would spend months, years, in prison. Probably he would never emerge. On the plane, Navalny shrugged off these concerns with his usual dark humour. “I am not afraid,” he said. He spent the flight watching his favourite show, the US cartoon sitcom Rick and Morty.\n\nWas Navalny’s decision to face down Vladimir Putin an act of supreme courage, a modern-day echo of the doomed revolt by the Decembrists against autocratic rule? Or was it suicidal folly? After all, Navalny embodies the best chance for democratic change inside Russia since the crumbling of the USSR.\nAs Navalny had gambled, his arrest in Moscow sparked big protests against the Kremlin. Demonstrators took to the squares of 180 towns and cities, from occupied Crimea to Vladivostok. They demanded his release. But this not-quite revolution never really threatened Putin’s two-decade rule or dented his control.\nWhile Navalny sits in jail, Putin appears ready to carry on as president well into his 80s. Security forces have quelled the street protests for now using time-honoured tactics: brutal force, mass arrests and enhanced persecution for a few. More repression is under way. Dissent, the message goes, has nasty consequences.\nOver the space of a few months, the authorities have rolled up Navalny’s formidable anti-corruption movement, banning his countrywide network of local campaign offices. They have shut down Russia’s few remaining independent media outlets as well, branding them “foreign agents” and “undesirable”. Free speech is in trouble.\nWith alarming speed, Russia is edging towards what the authors of a new study call “full-blown dictatorship”. The three non-Russian academics – Jan Matti Dollbaum, Morvan Lallouet and Ben Noble – have written an engaging and timely book about Navalny the man, the politician and the protester.\nIts subtitle asks: “Putin’s nemesis, Russia’s future?” No one quite knows if Navalny is indeed Russia’s destiny or a tragic national footnote, fated to be finished off by the same bungling FSB spy agency team that last summer tried to kill him in Siberia, poisoning his underpants.\nThe book convincingly argues that Navalny is the most interesting and significant figure to emerge from the post-communist period. It traces his early career as a blogger and activist to his present status, as Putin’s globally recognised arch enemy and biggest headache.\nNavalny is neither Nelson Mandela nor Alexander Solzhenitsyn, the authors suggest. Instead, he is himself: inspiring, complex, charismatic, brash and superbly media-savvy. And funny too, his humour a cudgel used to bash his enemies. Above all, Navalny is a politician, tactically flexible, contradictory and polarising.\nBorn in 1976, Navalny came from a generation that grew up in the USSR but was never defined by it. In the 1990s, he worked as a lawyer and a stockbroker. A right-wing, pro-business “punk”, according to friends, he entered politics during the early Putin era as a worker with the liberal Yabloko party.\nThe party expelled him in 2007 after he joined a march of Russian nationalists in Moscow. Many of those attending were neo-Nazi skinheads. Navalny once likened Chechen terrorists to cockroaches and still advocates a visa regime for central Asian guest workers.\nDoes this make him racist? Navalny has never fully disavowed his early radical views, though his platform these days is that of a mainstream, pro-European, social democrat, more left than right. The book explains Navalny’s forays into nationalism by quoting his view that an opposition needs to be popular. Only then can it be effective.\nIt was Navalny’s campaign against rampant state corruption that got him noticed. He probed the ownership of corporations and private companies such as the oil trader Gunvor. (The US Treasury says Putin benefits from it; the firm denies this.) When I met him in 2010, Navalny sketched out schemes for me on a giant whiteboard.\nThe following year, Navalny addressed anti-government rallies and came up with a memorable slogan for the ruling United Russia party – the “party of crooks and thieves”. He ran an impressive campaign to become Moscow mayor, winning a third of the vote. Then in 2012 he launched FBK, an anti-corruption foundation. This became his main political vehicle.\nThe authors write well about the role played by corruption in Russian politics. They note that under Putin stealing has shifted from being something that undermines state control into a tool for disciplining the elites. Everyone is complicit. And therefore vulnerable to punitive criminal charges. “Stealing is organised to buttress power,” the book asserts.\nIt adds that Navalny’s rise has only become possible because of the internet. Shut out from state TV and smeared in the Kremlin media, Navalny has turned to the online world to get his ideas out. He has developed an audience through slick YouTube videos, a daily show and Instagram and Twitter channels, where he has 2.6m followers. (Putin, a techno-dinosaur, doesn’t use email.)\nIn his cat-and-mouse battle with the authorities, Navalny has employed ingenious tactics. His aides have flown drones over the palaces of Russia’s venal KGB overlords. The FBK investigation into Dmitry Medvedev, Russia’s one-time president and PM, was a bravura piece of storytelling and sleuthing. It began with Medvedev’s trainers and ended with lavish homes and a Tuscan vineyard.\nEven critics recognise Navalny is courageous. His blockbuster investigation into Putin’s Black Sea palace was released just after his return to Moscow. Navalny depicts Putin in scathing terms, as a small-time bureaucrat who graduated from stealing cassette recorders as a junior spy in east Germany to looting an entire country. “A thieving little man in a bunker” in Navalny’s jibe.\nThe three academics say the Kremlin takes the threat posed by Navalny seriously. It has jailed him on various occasions and filed criminal charges. In 2017, it blocked him from standing to be president. Last year, an exasperated Putin gave a secret order to have him killed, Navalny alleges. Two of the Russian doctors who treated him for novichok poisoning have met mysterious deaths.\nThus far, Putin has acted ruthlessly in quashing rivals, but the book points out that his regime is adaptable and realistic. It has worked hard to gain the support of ordinary Russians and to build an emotional connection with them. As Navalny himself recognises, Putin is popular. Even with fair elections and a free media, Putin might just beat Navalny in a head-to-head poll.\nNot that this will ever happen. Navalny has talked cheerfully about his previous stints behind bars, saying that he gets to meet people from all walks of life and has an opportunity to read. His supporters are convinced he will eventually prevail against an older generation obsessed with the ghosts of the past and Soviet geopolitical fantasies. Maybe. For now, though, his life hangs by a thread.\nLuke Harding’s Shadow State: Murder, Mayhem and Russia’s Remaking of the West is published in a new updated edition by Guardian Faber\n Navalny: Putin’s Nemesis, Russia’s Future? by Jan Matti Dollbaum, Morvan Lallouet and Ben Noble is published by Hurst (£20).

  "Russia is producing two new Doomsday planes, says government news agency",
  "Russia is producing two new Doomsday planes, says government news agency\n ZHUKOVSKY, Russia — Russia is reportedly working on two so-called Doomsday planes to carry the country’s senior military and political leadership in case of a nuclear attack.\n The Russian Air Force and Space Forces will receive two airborne commanding posts based on the Il-96-400M plane, according to Russian government news agency RIA Novosti, citing a source in the country’s defense sector.\n The Il-96-400M is the modernized version of the Il-96 long-haul, wide-body civilian jetliner. An Il-96 variant currently operates as President Vladimir Putin’s primary means of travel by air, similar to that of the United States’ Air Force One.\n Both Russian planes will be remodeled in the city of Voronezh, a several-hours drive from Moscow at the Voronezh Aircraft Production Association’s aviation assembly plant, which produces transport planes for civilian and military use.\n RIA Novosti reported the source said that a third such plane will be made in the future.\n The new Doomsday plane is to replace the more outdated Il-80 plane, based on the Il-86 civilian version.\n Russian media reported December 2020 that parts of the radio equipment from one the Il-80 Doomsday planes were stolen during maintenance in the city of Taganrog. An unemployed local citizen was later charged with the crime. The plane’s location at the repair facility was allegedly poorly guarded. Retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Vladimir Popov told Russain daily Moskovsky Komsomolets at the time that thieves were possibly looking for parts containing precious metals.\nAlexander Bratersky is the Russia correspondent at Defense News. He has covered U.S.-Russian relations, NATO and Middle Eastern affairs, and Russian policy in Syria.

The move will leave around 120 officials working in Moscow, with zero locally hired employees, known as “foreign service nationals.” This is down from roughly 350 U.S. diplomats and 1,900 foreign service nationals operating the U.S. Embassy in Moscow and consulates across Russia a decade ago, according to current and former U.S. diplomats.

U.S. Ambassador to Russia John Sullivan said in an interview with NPR earlier this month there were around 1,200 people working for the U.S. mission in 2017.\nThe soon-to-be implemented restrictions illustrate how far U.S.-Russia relations have fallen in recent years, even as the Biden administration tries to keep the door for improving bilateral ties at least slightly cracked open.\nAs the Aug. 1 deadline approaches, some U.S. diplomats inside the State Department are growing frustrated with the Biden administration for not issuing a more forceful response to Russia’s restrictions. The Biden administration has not signaled it will make any move to retaliate, including by curtailing the number of Russian diplomats posted at its consulates in Houston or New York or its embassy in Washington.\nVeteran diplomats and other experts say the new restrictions will all but destroy the U.S. mission’s ability to carry out routine diplomatic work, from political engagement to visa and consular services, given how important local hires are to the day-to-day functions of an embassy. Sullivan said in an interview last month that the last two remaining consulates in Russia, in Yekaterinburg and in Vladivostok, will suspend operations due to the staff cuts.\nScott Rauland, a former career U.S. foreign service officer who had served as U.S. consul general in Yekaterinburg, described it as a massive blow to U.S. diplomacy in Russia. “At the very least Russia has succeeded in hobbling our entire diplomatic infrastructure there for the short term,” he said. “For those consulates, it could take years to get them back and fully functional again.”\nHeather Conley, an expert on Russia and Europe with the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the new restrictions reflected a “new low point” in U.S.-Russia relations.\nDespite the souring in relations with Moscow, U.S. President Joe Biden has attempted to reengage with the former Cold War rival on some diplomatic fronts, including arms control talks, efforts to revive the Iran nuclear deal, and the future of Afghanistan after the U.S. military withdrawal. Notably, Biden has agreed to waive further U.S. sanctions on a controversial Russian gas pipeline to Germany, Nord Stream 2, in a bid meant to repair U.S. ties with Berlin but one that has also opened the president to attacks from Republican lawmakers that he is too soft on Russia.\nBiden met with Putin in June in Geneva, where Biden called for a “predictable and rational” relationship with Russia and sought to establish some “basic rules of the road” for how the two countries engage. The summit came after Biden in March sparked a diplomatic rift with Putin when he called the Russian president a “killer.” Russia recalled its U.S. envoy, Anatoly Antonov, for consultations shortly after. He returned to Washington in June.\nDespite these efforts, many experts believe relations remain on a downward spiral with few, if any, offramps. They point to a spate of high-profile cyberattacks on U.S. infrastructure attributed to Kremlin-backed hackers and mysterious health problems experienced by U.S. diplomats and intelligence officials that some experts believe Russian government operatives to be behind.\nIn a speech to U.S. intelligence officials on Tuesday, Biden asserted that Putin is increasingly dangerous as his country declines on the world stage. “He’s sitting on top of an economy that has nuclear weapons and oil wells and nothing else. Nothing else,” Biden said. “Their economy is—what?—the eighth smallest in the world now—largest in the world? He knows—he knows he’s in real trouble, which makes him even more dangerous, in my view.”\nWith only a fraction of the staff it once had, Conley said, the U.S. Embassy will struggle to perform most basic diplomatic functions as it tries to manage increasingly strained ties between the two countries. “It’s really crippling U.S. reporting capabilities across Russia and preventing us from understanding what’s happening there, and it’s also crippling our ability to maintain people-to-people contacts, which is so essential when our governments are struggling in their relationship,” she said.\nThe State Department did not respond to several requests for comment for this story.\nRauland, as well several other current diplomats who spoke to Foreign Policy on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to speak to the media, described foreign service nationals as crucial to an embassy or consulate’s day-to-day operations and a vital conduit for U.S. diplomats to local populations.\nMost U.S. diplomatic outposts rely heavily on local employees for day-to-day operations. They provide everything from language and translation skills, to cultural advice, to administrative work and plumbing and electricity maintenance.\n“Where it really hurts is [there will be] no local experts to advise American officers on complex political and economic issues,” Rauland said. Foreign service officers “come and go every few years, but the local staff are the institutional memory of the embassy,” he said.\nRobbie Gramer is a diplomacy and national security reporter at Foreign Policy. Twitter: @RobbieGramer\n\n\n\n\n\nNEW FOR SUBSCRIBERS:\nWant to read more on this topic or region?

  "Russia against US troops in Central Asia near Afghanistan",
  "Russia against US troops in Central Asia near Afghanistan\nMOSCOW (AP) — Russia has strongly warned the United States against deploying its troops in the former Soviet Central Asian nations following their withdrawal from Afghanistan, a senior diplomat said in remarks published on Tuesday.\nRussia’s Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said that Moscow conveyed the message to Washington during Russian President Vladimir Putin’s summit with U.S. President Joe Biden in Geneva last month. \nThe warning comes as the U.S. military said last week that 90% of the withdrawal of U.S. troops and equipment from Afghanistan is complete. Biden said the U.S. military mission in Afghanistan will conclude on Aug. 31.\n“I would emphasize that the redeployment of the American permanent military presence to the countries neighboring Afghanistan is unacceptable,” Ryabkov said. “We told the Americans in a direct and straightforward way that it would change a lot of things not only in our perceptions of what’s going on in that important region, but also in our relations with the United States.”\nHe added that Russia has also issued the warning to Central Asian nations.\n“We cautioned them against such steps, and we also have had a frank talk on the subject with our Central Asian allies, neighbors and friends and also other countries in the region that would be directly affected,” Ryabkov said in an interview published in the Mezhdunarodnaya Zhizn magazine.\nOn Monday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov emphasized that Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan are all members of the Collective Security Treaty Organization, and any presence of foreign troops on their territories must be endorsed by the security pact. He added that none of those countries have raised the issue.\nTajikistan and Kyrgyzstan both host Russian military bases. Kyrgyzstan, which hosted a U.S. military base that supported operations in Afghanistan, closed it in 2014.\nUzbekistan, which also hosted a U.S. base, ordered it shut in 2005 amid tensions with Washington. Uzbekistan’s Defense Ministry reaffirmed in May that the country’s constitution and its military doctrine rule out the presence of any foreign troops on its territory.\n“I don’t think that the emergence of new American military facilities in Central Asia would promote security in the region,” Lavrov said.\nThe Biden administration has reportedly considered Uzbekistan and Tajikistan that border Afghanistan, as well as Kazakhstan, as possible staging areas for monitoring and quickly responding to possible security problems that may follow the U.S. military’s withdrawal from Afghanistan. \n“I don’t think that anyone is interested in becoming a hostage to such US policy and intentions, and in inviting retaliation,” Lavrov said.\nThe Russian foreign minister questioned what results would be achieved with a small U.S. presence outside Afghanistan when a 100,000-strong NATO force inside the country “failed to do anything.”\n“Most probably, they simply want to ensure their military presence in Central Asia and be able to influence the situation in this region.” \nAs the American and NATO troops were swiftly pulling out, the Taliban have made quick gains across the country. They claimed on Friday that they now control 85% of Afghanistan’s territory.\nRussian officials have expressed concern that the Taliban surge could destabilize Central Asia.\nTaliban advances already have forced hundreds of Afghan soldiers to flee across the border into Tajikistan which called up 20,000 military reservists to strengthen its southern border with Afghanistan. \nLast week, a senior Taliban delegation visited Moscow to offer assurances that the insurgents’ advances in Afghanistan do not threaten Russia or its allies in Central Asia.

  "Check your email for details on your request.\nLess Than a Full Deck: Russia’s Economic Influence in the Mediterranean\nIf you enjoyed reading this, subscribe for more!\nCheck your email for details on your request.\nRussia’s intervention in Syria in 2015, and then subsequently in Libya, marked its return as a major actor in the Mediterranean. Much has been made of Russia’s use of all elements of statecraft, including diplomatic, ideological, military, and economic instruments, to advance its interests in this region, a vital shipping and transit corridor. A closer look at Russia’s economic tool kit in this region, however, suggests concerns about Russian economic capabilities are likely overstated.\nRussia’s most important economic tools in the Mediterranean are its energy resources, arms exports, and ability to launder money through corrupt networks. These tools have complemented Russia’s diplomatic and military activities, particularly in areas where economic systems and rule of law have been weaker. Where Russia has been successful, it has increased a country’s dependence on Russian money, oil and gas, and/or arms, giving it a say in a country’s policymaking, particularly on matters of importance to Russia, and a way to undermine U.S. and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization’s (NATO) influence in the region.\nIn particular, Russia’s unique economic tools have helped it manage its otherwise difficult relationship with Turkey, which depends on Russian oil and gas and is a new customer for Russian nuclear power and weapons systems. Turkey is a unique example in the Mediterranean where Russia already had a substantial trade and investment relationship beyond hydrocarbons, and then used these newer, more subversive tools to build its influence. These same tools have allowed Russia to gain more influence in Egypt, Algeria, and to some degree Cyprus over the last decade.\nThese tools have proved of limited utility elsewhere, however, as they have not been backed by the traditional instruments of economic statecraft: trade in non-energy goods and services, foreign direct investment, and development assistance. Russia has trailed the United States and Europe, and in some cases China, in deploying these fundamental economic elements of foreign policy in the Mediterranean region. Based on economic data available, Russia’s bilateral trade with individual Mediterranean countries is low, its investment levels in most Mediterranean countries are insubstantial, and it is not giving large quantities of development assistance to the poorer countries along the Mediterranean’s eastern and southern rims. The lack of these traditional economic ties is surprising, given Russia’s military and diplomatic efforts to increase its influence in the region. Without them, Russia’s economic diplomacy in the region is highly based on symbolism and the relationships lack sustainability over the long term, which undercuts its geopolitical ambitions in the Mediterranean.\nIf Russia’s ambitions in the Mediterranean region are limited to maintaining access, currying favor with key decisionmakers, and remaining a nuisance to NATO, then its current level of economic ties is likely sufficient. If Russia aims to grow its influence and clout with more countries in the region, however, its current economic tool kit does not appear to be large or sophisticated enough to achieve this.\nEconomic statecraft is an important tool in any country’s foreign policy. Trade and investment deals link countries together in vital ways to improve living standards in each country. They also build relationships between people—politicians, business leaders, students, tourists—that promote mutual understanding and respect for each other’s cultures. The United States and the European Union (EU) have generally excelled in building these types of economic ties in the post–World War II era, and economic data show they continue to be the dominant economic powers in the Mediterranean. Continuing this leadership in the economy will likely ensure that Russian influence in the Mediterranean remains a manageable, if persistent, problem for the West.\nFor nearly a decade now, Russia has pursued a more aggressive foreign policy, seeking to return to countries and regions beyond its immediate neighborhood where it has been absent since the end of the Cold War.1 One such region is the Mediterranean, where it has used a variety of tools to expand its influence in the littoral countries of this critical transit corridor for global shipping and trade. With the Black Sea, the Mediterranean is Russia’s critical outlet to the world’s oceans and it has long been a major arena of its geopolitical and commercial pursuits.2 While Russia pulled back from the region at the end of the Cold War to focus on its domestic problems, its intervention in Syria in 2015, and then in Libya, marked its return as a major actor in the region. Much has been made of Russia using all elements of statecraft, including diplomatic, ideological, military, and economic instruments, in pursuit of its goals in the Mediterranean. However, a closer look at its economic tool kit suggests concerns about its capabilities are overstated.\nRussia’s most important economic tools in the Mediterranean are its energy resources, arms exports, and money laundering through corrupt networks. These tools have complemented Russia’s diplomatic and military activities, particularly in the Middle East, North Africa, and the Balkans. Where Russia has been successful, it has increased dependence on its money, oil and gas, and/or arms, giving it a say in a country’s policymaking, particularly on matters of importance to Russia, and a way to undermine U.S. and NATO influence in the region. These tools have proved of limited utility, however, as they have not been backed by other traditional means of economic statecraft such as trade in non-energy goods and services, foreign direct investment, and development assistance. Russia has trailed the United States and Europe, and in some cases China, in deploying these more fundamental economic instruments of foreign policy in the Mediterranean. Without them, Russia’s relationships lack sustainability over the long term, which undercuts its geopolitical ambitions in the region.\nThe largest economic tool Russia can bring to bear in the Mediterranean, or anywhere, is its vast supply of oil and natural gas. Energy exports have consistently totaled half of its export earnings worldwide.3 Russia has used its position as the key oil and gas supplier repeatedly against its closest neighbors, such as Ukraine, through rewards and punishment, to keep them in line with its policy choices.4 In the Mediterranean, however, where Russia does not have a monopoly on energy supplies as in many of the former Soviet states, energy is an important lever but not necessarily an instrument of coercion. Maintaining and expanding influence in the energy field require continuous effort by Russia to expand its network of gas pipelines, as well as gaining footholds in new gas development projects. With new gas discoveries in the Eastern Mediterranean and large, although diminishing,5 demand for oil and gas throughout the region, energy politics are central to Russia’s tools of statecraft in the region.\nNot all Mediterranean countries import Russian gas, as distance and/or local supplies make Russian piped gas cost-prohibitive or unnecessary. These factors force Russia to focus on Southern Europe, but it must do so with Turkey serving as a central node and partner, especially since its previous efforts to build pipeline infrastructure around the country have come to naught. The Kremlin has been remarkably successful in maintaining increasingly close energy cooperation with Ankara despite being on opposite sides of three different regional conflicts in recent years,6 largely by compartmentalizing disagreements and playing to President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s disenchantment with the West and ambitions to make Turkey a regional gas distribution hegemon. Russian-Turkish energy cooperation has led to the completion of several large-scale pipeline projects.7 Beginning with the Blue Stream pipeline, which was completed in 2003, new pipeline projects have increased Turkey’s consumption of Russian gas while allowing Russia to bypass Ukraine to send gas to Southern European destinations—a clear win for both countries. As of January 2020, when the Turkstream pipeline across the Black Sea began operations, Turkey stopped receiving Russian gas through the Trans-Balkan Pipeline from Ukraine, which it had done since the mid-1980s.8 The second phase of Turkstream envisions extending the pipeline through Bulgaria all the way to Hungary, weakening Ukraine’s position as a transit state and transforming Turkey into a more important node for gas deliveries to Europe, again a win for both Moscow and Ankara.\nStill, the example of Turkey illustrates the limits of natural gas as a lever of influence for Russia. The shale gas revolution has drastically brought down the cost of natural gas, reducing the revenues Russia can gain from gas sales, while the EU’s Third Energy Package has limited its monopoly power over gas distribution. According to data from the Bank of Russia, the country’s revenues from global gas exports peaked in 2013 at $71.5 billion, and they have not returned to near that level since, with the global recession spurred by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 bringing the total down to $32 billion, a level not seen since 2005 (see Figure 1).9 Moreover, the spread of liquefied natural gas (LNG) technology allows countries to import gas from anywhere, free from a dependency on pipelines that are costly to build and maintain. By expanding its use of LNG (as the third-largest importer in the world in 2020), Turkey no longer has to rely solely on piped gas from Russia, Azerbaijan, and Iran, but is diversifying its supply from at least seven new partners, including increasing volumes from the United States.10 In 2020, Russia remained Turkey’s largest gas supplier at 16.3 billion cubic meters, but imports of gas from the United States grew by 144 percent to 3 billion cubic meters (see Figure 2).11 Turkey also has long-term contracts for LNG with Algeria and Nigeria. Moreover, by becoming a central node in Russia’s gas distribution system, Turkey gains the same leverage Ukraine used in the past—the ability to negotiate down the price it pays for its own imports in order to allow Russian gas to flow through its territory and on to the rest of Europe. Taken together, these steps have reduced Russia’s ability to use gas as political leverage with Turkey, even if they have not eliminated it. Moreover, cooperation on gas projects is in the interests of both countries as they look to expand their influence in Southeastern Europe.\n\n\nRussian gas companies have also expanded aggressively into new markets in the Mediterranean, offering financing and expertise to develop new fields. In 2008, Russia’s Gazprom began oil and gas exploration in Algeria, after signing a memorandum of understanding in 2006 with Algeria’s state-owned Sonatrach.12 The partnership has confirmed reserves in the El-Assel basin through exploratory wells but has not yet begun commercial production. In 2017, Russia’s Rosneft purchased a 30 percent stake in the Zohr gas field off Egypt (other partners are Italy’s ENI at 50 percent, BP at 10 percent, and the United Arab Emirates’ Mubadala Petroleum also at 10 percent), the largest discovered in the Mediterranean.13 Production at Zohr has exceeded the joint venture’s expectations, reaching 2.7 billion cubic feet per day by August 2019.14 Russian firm Novatek has a 20 percent stake in a consortium (along with France’s TOTAL and Italy’s ENI) to explore Lebanon’s offshore fields. The agreement was signed in 2018 but production has not yet started.15 These deals ensure Russia remains a key player in all gas discussions in the Mediterranean.\nWhile natural gas gets most of the attention, oil and oil products constitute around 80 percent of Russia’s energy income, with piped and liquefied natural gas contributing 20 percent.16 Oil is the largest source of funds for Russia’s state budget including its foreign policy adventures.17 All twenty-one Mediterranean littoral states have imported some oil from Russia since 2012, although not all in substantial quantities. European countries, as the largest economies of the region, are the largest consumers of Russian oil, but the countries in the Eastern Mediterranean and North Africa have generally purchased less than $100–$200 million worth annually.18\nDependence on Russian oil might at one time have been a lever of political influence in some European countries of the region, but the Mediterranean is of declining importance to Russia as a customer. In 2013, Mediterranean countries consumed 20 percent of Russia’s oil exports; in 2020 this figure was 15 percent.19 The drop comes largely from European countries reducing their consumption (see Figure 3). The reduction in imports of Russian oil was likely market-driven, rather than geopolitically motivated, as oil is a widely traded commodity whose price fell substantially after 2014. Mandates to move toward cleaner energy sources and fewer emissions have also driven down the EU’s demand for oil and will continue to do so over the coming decades. Overall, the substantial drop in Europe’s demand for Russian oil lessens the potential impact of this arrow in Russia’s quiver.\n\nAnother key part of Russia’s economic influence tool kit globally is the conclusion of deals to build nuclear power plants abroad. The Russian national security establishment views civilian nuclear power exports as an important tool for projecting influence as well as creating revenue streams for sustaining intellectual and technical capabilities and vital programs in Russia.20 Nuclear power plants are expensive, however, and not without risk. They can be of dubious value to the host government, or saddle the state nuclear power monopoly Rosatom with debts it cannot collect. Therefore, Russia has more often than not overpromised and underdelivered when signing agreements to build nuclear plants. Most are never fully implemented. The Mediterranean, which has plentiful conventional energy resources, has not been a major target of Russia’s nuclear ambitions. On the European rim, France and Spain have domestically owned nuclear programs and both have committed to reducing nuclear power, while Italy shuttered its program after the Chernobyl disaster in 1987.21\nRosatom has signed agreements, however, with Turkey and Egypt for large nuclear plant projects. Turkey signed its agreement in 2010 under which Rosatom will build, own, and operate the country’s first nuclear power plant at Akkuyu, which will have a total capacity of 4,800 megawatts (MW).22 This model means Rosatom will have a long-term presence at Akkuyu, with near-complete operational control over the plant. The company plans to open the first unit of the four-unit plant in 2023, in time for the hundredth anniversary of the Turkish republic.23 In the case of Egypt’s plant, which is also supposed to deliver 4,800 MW, the country’s authorities will operate it after construction, but Russia will have a long-term role in training Egyptian workers and providing and disposing of fuel. While Egypt has sought to build a nuclear power plant for decades, the decision to sign with Rosatom in 2015 over bids from U.S., Chinese, French, and South Korean firms lacked transparency, and observers suspect it may have been taken as a step to encourage Russia to restart tourism to Egypt, which Russia had halted earlier in the year.24 Egypt has contracted with U.S. firm General Electric and with Australian consultancy Worley Ltd. for other parts of the project, however. Approximately 85 percent of the financing for the plant will come from a $25 billion loan from Russia, and some in Egypt have said the plant is unnecessary given that the country has an electricity surplus with its current supply sources. Construction has not yet begun.25 Like other Rosatom projects around the globe, the Turkish and Egyptian nuclear power plants appear to be geopolitical projects of somewhat dubious economic merit, but it seems unlikely Russia would be able to replicate this model elsewhere in the Mediterranean.\nContinuing its decades-long legacy, Russia was the world’s second-largest exporter of arms, after the United States, between 2016 and 2020.26 According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), it accounted for 20 percent of all arms exported during this period. Russia’s arms sales provide it direct engagement with foreign countries’ leaders, relationship-building tools with their militaries, and profits for its arms-producing enterprises. This is a major tool Russia uses for influence in the Mediterranean, but with most of the northern littoral states being NATO members, its arms-sales relationships focus on the eastern and southern ones (see Figure 4).\n\nOf these countries, Algeria, Egypt, and Turkey deserve special mention. Algeria remains Russia’s largest client in the Mediterranean, having been one since Soviet times. Between 2016 and 2020 it was also the largest arms importer in Africa and the sixth-largest in the world, importing 4.3 percent of all the arms imported globally during this period.27 Given Algeria’s demand for weapons and its ability to pay for them, maintaining market share in the country has been a priority for Russia in the region. In 2006, Moscow agreed to write off $4.6 billion in debt from the Soviet era in exchange for Algeria signing $7.5 billion in new contracts for weapons purchases.28 Following this deal, Russia supplied over 80 percent of Algeria’s imported arms from 2006 to 2013. Starting in 2011, however, Algeria began to diversify its imports, concluding deals with France, Italy, Germany, and even China for ships and accompanying weapons, armored personnel carriers, and armed unmanned aerial vehicles.29 As delivery on these contracts was made, Russia’s market share dropped to 55 percent between 2014 and 2016. After 2016, Russia worked diligently to regain its position, selling and transferring sixteen combat aircraft, forty-two combat helicopters and two submarines to Algeria through 2020. Maintaining market dominance is important to Russia, but this volatility suggests that it cannot rely on past sales to remain competitive, even in its key markets.\nEgypt is a newer success story for Russia. The United States reduced arms sales to the country during and after the Arab Spring, eventually freezing arms exports in the wake of the military taking over the government in 2013. That embargo lasted two years, until the multiple ongoing conflicts in the Middle East forced then U.S. president Barack Obama’s administration to reverse course.30 Russia filled this gap left by the United States and rapidly expanded its arms sales to Egypt. Arms contracts, in general, take time between signature and delivery, so the effect of this increased procurement from Russia can be seen in arms transfer data starting only in 2016, when Russia and the United States transferred roughly an equal value of weapons to Egypt (see Figure 5). Since then, the value of Russia’s supplies has exceeded that of the United States, and has included fifty combat aircraft and forty-six ship-borne combat helicopters. These sales have also led to closer military cooperation, including joint exercises.31 While President Joe Biden’s administration has announced it will continue to supply Egypt with arms despite concerns over human rights abuses,32 the previous years of delay created an opening for Russia and a desire on the part of Egyptian leadership to diversify away from just one supplier.33\n\nTurkey is also a success story for Russia’s arms sales strategy. As a long-standing NATO ally, Turkey did not purchase Russian arms between 1950 and 2017, other than some second-hand armored personnel carriers and helicopters in the early 1990s to be used by the police.34 Instead, Turkey imported arms only from other NATO allies, and developed its own arms industry. According to SIPRI, from 2016 to 2020 Turkey dropped from being the sixth-largest arms importer to the twentieth, due to the development of its own defense industry.35 Yet in 2017, it agreed to purchase the S-400 missile defense system from Russia over the strong objections of the United States and other NATO allies. At the same time, the U.S.-Turkish relationship had deteriorated over differences on cooperation with Syrian Kurdish forces, the 2016 attempted coup in Turkey, and the subsequent U.S. refusal to extradite cleric Fetullah Gülen, as well as Washington’s reluctance to sell Patriot air defense systems on Turkish terms. Turkey felt the United States and NATO had done little to help it reduce its vulnerability to attack from the conflict in Syria.36 Moscow capitalized on this frustration with the West and vulnerability to Russia’s role in Syria to offer the S-400 system, which Erdoğan quickly accepted. This sale was a clever move to drive a wedge between Turkey and its NATO allies, as the United States was forced to respond by removing Turkey from the F-35 fighter jet program for fear of release of sensitive technology to Russia through the S-400 system. Discussions reportedly continue between the Turkish government and the Biden administration on a path forward on the issue of the S-400 system, which Turkey has tested but which is not yet in full use.37 In this case, the sale of a weapons system met Russia’s economic, military, and geostrategic goals in one tidy package—a model Russia likely will look to replicate elsewhere, if the right factors are present.\nRussia is frequently accused of using illicit financial transfers, corruption, and other organized criminal activity as economic tools of influence.38 Although it is generally difficult to link alleged illicit financial transfers from Russia directly to its government, in many cases they can be traced to individuals, companies, and other Russian-owned networks with ties to the Russian state. Through money-laundering schemes, funds obtained illegally in Russia can be moved out of the country and then used to buy real estate or other legitimate goods and services, transferring them into what otherwise appear to be legal assets. Such “dirty” money (or even “clean” money) transferred out of the country can be used to fund corruption or other illicit dealings in the destination country that further Russia’s geopolitical interests.\nIn the Mediterranean, there are numerous examples of allegedly illicit Russian money flowing to both legitimate and illicit businesses, particularly along the northern littoral states. One of Russian opposition politician Alexey Navalny’s anti-corruption movies centers on the luxury Pomegranate hotel in Greece, which he alleges is owned by Artem Chaika, the son of Yuriy Chaika, who was Russia’s prosecutor general until 2020, and by Olga Lopatina, the ex-wife of Deputy Prosecutor General Gennady Lopatin.39 In 2015, Navalny accused the two Chaikas of owning a network of criminal enterprises across Russia, and that the Pomegranate hotel was just one of the enterprises they used to launder the proceeds. Navalny also accused Lopatina of connections to an organized criminal gang, and claimed she owned a large villa near the hotel.40\nIn the notorious Laundromat scheme allegedly involving money-laundering of over $20 billion, the money was funneled out of Russia to many countries around the world including some in the Mediterranean.41 According to the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP), Cyprus, Turkey, and Italy were the end destination for large sums of this money, with other smaller recipients in the region including Slovenia, France, Spain, Greece, Croatia, and Egypt. While the OCCRP was not able to track the owners of all the bank accounts involved, it found that the main users of the scheme were wealthy Russian businessmen who had made their fortunes through connections to the government.\nRussian money has no larger destination in the Mediterranean than Cyprus. The country’s low tax rate, double taxation treaty with Russia, and—until recently—low diligence on the source of funds, made it a top destination for Russian money since the end of the Soviet Union. At the time of Cyprus’s financial crisis in 2013, there was an estimated $32 billion in Russian cash in Cypriot banks, more than the country’s annual gross domestic product (GDP) at the time.42 Russian bank loans to Russian-owned companies registered in Cyprus totaled another $30–$40 billion.43 By another estimate, Russia was the source of 25 percent of inward and outward foreign direct investment (FDI) flows in Cyprus at the time, as Russians “roundtripped” their money between the two countries.44 Russians lost billions of euros in the bailout of Cyprus that followed the 2013 financial crisis, but the EU’s bailout conditions converted some of those losses into shares in Cypriot banks, unintentionally giving some control over these banks to the Russians the EU had been trying to force out.45\nEven after the large losses from the 2013 financial crisis, Russian money continues to flow to Cyprus. After it, in order to boost the economy the government offered a “golden passport” scheme for those investing at least €2 million in the country. Russians accounted for nearly half of the 3,153 passports awarded between 2013 and 2020 under the scheme, including some individuals who are now sanctioned by the United States and the EU.46 After a review of the program, Cyprus began the process of revoking the citizenship it gave to twenty-eight individuals, but their identity has not been made public. According to data published by the Bank of Russia, in 2019 Russia’s FDI in Cyprus was 50 percent of all of its FDI positions globally.47 Some of this investment is then transferred to other parts of the EU, making it more difficult to trace back to Russia. The Russian money going in and out of Cyprus has included legitimate transfers and some that funded criminal activity, such as money stolen from the Russian treasury and funneled through the now-shuttered FBME bank in Cyprus, and then used to fund the production of chemical weapons in Syria.48\nAnalysts have long worried about the leverage these vast flows of money and people give Russia over Cyprus’s policymaking and politicians. Certainly, adding Russians to the country’s voter rolls can have an impact on future elections, or on how decisions are made inside the government, and Russian emigrés have started a political party in the country to do so.49 In one small example, the anti-corruption activist and former owner of Hermitage Capital in Russia Bill Browder has accused a Cypriot government official of helping a Russian mobster launder his money through a property purchase in Cyprus.50 In a larger one, there have been no arrests to date in the FBME bank case. While Cyprus has not blocked the EU’s semi-annual renewal of sanctions on Russia for its aggression in Ukraine, as some feared, decisions such as the 2015 deal allowing Russian naval ships to access the country’s ports are evidence of the leverage Russian money can have.51\nEfforts by the EU and the United States to push Cyprus to improve its anti–money laundering practices have worked to some extent, as a 2019 report on its compliance with Financial Action Task Force regulations showed.52 The report concluded that several measures had been deployed since the previous 2011 report to deal with the major money laundering and terrorism financing threats facing the country, and that the banking sector had become more effective in mitigating these risks. Still, the report highlighted that the authorities must do more to pursue the proceeds of criminal activity generated outside Cyprus, which it identified as the largest threat to its financial system. Cyprus also missed the January 2020 deadline to translate the EU’s fifth anti–money laundering directive into domestic legislation.53 After a rebuke from the European Commission, the parliament finally passed the required legislation in February 2021, but it is too soon to evaluate how these changes will be implemented. This indicates that the flows of Russian money remain alluring to Cyprus’s policymakers, who continue to struggle with balancing its rule of law commitments as an EU member state with the desire for foreign funding to grow its economy.\nWhile Russia has used energy, weapons sales, and money laundering to build influence in several Mediterranean countries, it does not have, or has not been able to use as effectively, the normal major tools of economic statecraft, such as trade in non-energy goods and services, foreign direct investment, and development assistance, to build leverage in the region. Limited economic growth in Russia, along with its relatively small post-Soviet industrial base, leaves little room for building deep trade and investment relationships abroad. Low levels of domestic investment, in large part due to weak rule of law and little respect for property rights as well as fiscal austerity, mean Russia does not have enough resources to spur growth at home. Real GDP in Russia has grown on average by an anemic 0.9 percent annually between 2012 and 2019, and the COVID-19 pandemic is estimated to have shrunk the economy by a further 3.1 percent in 2020.54 Gross national income per capita began to fall after 2013. Russia is substantially poorer on a per capita basis than all the EU member states on the northern shores of the Mediterranean (see Figure 6). Living standards in Russia are roughly on par with those in Turkey but are higher than those in the countries on the southern coast of the Mediterranean.\n\nRussia’s government has relatively large foreign currency reserves built up over the past two decades. It could use some of these to fund development projects abroad, but thus far it has not done so. Falling international oil prices and Western financial sanctions ended Russia’s decade of massive balance of payments surpluses (1998–2008), and the government is no longer accumulating foreign currency reserves at the rate it previously did (see Figure 7). Still, these boom years and the tight fiscal policies of President Vladimir Putin’s administration left the Russian government with little foreign debt (13.8 percent of GDP in 2018) and a large sovereign wealth fund.55 Low debt and large reserves are walls of a fortress that help protect the economy from international shocks, such as new sanctions, but they also keep it isolated from the rest of the world and cause growth to stagnate.56 These isolationist choices limit the power of Russia’s economic tool kit in the Mediterranean, when compared to other actors in the region. Russia simply does not produce much of the goods and services consumers in the region want, and, other than nuclear power plants, it does not have the technology and resources to compete with China or the West on major infrastructure deals.\n\nRussia’s trade statistics do not indicate a country promoting trade as a major tool for building up dependence and influence globally or in the countries of the Mediterranean. The percentage of Russia’s GDP derived from exports fell between 2000 and 2009, reaching a low of 26 percent (see Figure 8). Since 2009 it has been essentially flat. The rate of imports has also been constant at around 20 percent of GDP since 2000. Hydrocarbons dominate this limited trade, as discussed above. Beyond these, Russia exports mostly primary commodities (precious metals and stones, iron and steel, cereals) rather than more advanced manufactured goods that a global economic powerhouse would normally export (see Figure 9).\n\n\nThe twenty-one states of the Mediterranean have played a declining, but still important, role in Russia’s limited trade. While in 2013 they accounted for 18 percent of Russia’s total global trade, by 2020 that share had shrunk to 14.4 percent.57 The drop comes almost entirely from a steep decline in the value of Russia’s trade with Italy after 2014, when the EU and Russia imposed sanctions on each other in response to Russia’s military aggression against Ukraine, and simultaneously the price of oil went into a steep decline. By 2019 Turkey overtook Italy as Russia’s largest trading partner in the Mediterranean, and each country accounted for just under 4 percent to Russia’s total trade in 2020. Other than with Italy, the share of each Mediterranean country in Russia’s trade has remained consistent, indicating trade is not becoming a more important part of its influence tool kit in the region.\nIf trade between Russia and a Mediterranean country were particularly one-sided, or concentrated in a specific, vital industry, in Russia’s favor, this would give it an important tool for influence. However, the three largest economies in the region—France, Italy, and Spain—as well as Portugal and Slovenia have trade surpluses with Russia (see Figure 10). Fifteen other Mediterranean countries have a consistent trade deficit with Russia, however. Turkey and Egypt have the largest trade deficits, and therefore deserve a deeper examination, as does the change in Italy’s trade with Russia since 2014.\n\nWhile Soviet-Turkish trade was roughly balanced throughout the Cold War, after the Russian financial crisis in 1998 Turkey’s energy imports from Russia surpassed the amount of goods Russia could afford to buy from Turkey.58 This pattern in goods trade has continued through the Putin-Erdoğan period, with oil and gas exports from Russia to Turkey consistently worth twenty times any single import category from Turkey. The size of the trade deficit narrows but remains significant if services are included, as Russia is consistently in deficit to Turkey in trade in services (by $6.4 billion in 2019), consisting mostly of Russian tourism to Turkey ($5.7 billion in 2019 exports) and construction services ($1.1 billion in 2019 exports). In addition to these two sectors, Turkey exports mostly fruit but also machinery and passenger vehicles to Russia. When a political crisis erupted between the two countries in 2015 after Turkey shot down a Russian fighter jet on its border with Syria, Moscow turned to trade sanctions on fruit and tourism to punish Ankara. While there was a cost to Russia for these measures, Turkey took the bigger hit, forcing Erdoğan to apologize for the incident.59 In April 2021, Russia imposed another tourism ban on Turkey, likely to signal discontent over Turkish support to Ukraine.60 Turkey’s trade deficit with Russia continues to be a political vulnerability and is likely to continue to be a valuable influence tool for Moscow.\nTurkey is the exception, however, that proves Russia’s lack of trade power in the rest of the Mediterranean. It is not clear that Russia could pull off a similar policy victory through trade sanctions against any other Mediterranean country. For example, Egypt’s smaller trade deficit with Russia comes not from hydrocarbons but from wheat purchases. Egypt imports 35 percent of its wheat from Russia, the largest supplier for the country. But Egypt also accounts for 19 percent of Russia’s wheat exports, making it the second-largest importer for Russian producers. Were Moscow to cut off wheat exports to Egypt as a political measure, it would discover, as Turkey found with Russia’s ban on its fruit, that finding new markets quickly for a vast amount of perishable exports is not easy. Therefore such a move would likely be equally harmful to Russia as it would be to Egypt, and not a useful tool of influence. In addition, Egypt used to earn over $3 billion annually from Russian tourism, but Russia stopped all charter flights to the country in late 2015 after a terrorist incident on a charter flight. This cut tourism revenues from Russia to essentially zero, but it did little to change the political dynamic between the countries, despite billions of dollars in lost revenue for Egypt. The two countries announced in April 2021 they would restart the flights. The timing of the announcement, however, seemed linked less to improved safety measures at Egyptian airports than to the dynamics of Russia’s relationship with Turkey, as it coincided with the latest tourism ban on the country.\nRussia’s trade with Italy shows how vulnerable its reliance on hydrocarbons makes it in the larger global trading space. The two countries had rather balanced trade until 2009, when the value of the oil and gas Italy imported from Russia exceeded the amount of mostly manufactured goods and machinery Russia could afford to buy from Italy, given the global financial crisis (see Figure 11). As the price of oil and gas fell after 2014, however, the trade values returned to more of a balance.\n\nOver the long run, as Italy and the rest of Europe turn away from fossil fuels, and the Eastern Mediterranean develops its own energy resources, Russia will be left with a commodity of less and less value to trade for the high-quality goods it currently imports from Italy and Europe. Without investment to grow and modernize its manufacturing sector, Russia’s trade surplus with the Mediterranean is likely to shrink over time, giving it less leverage over the region. Therefore, trade is not, and likely never will be, a coercive tool for Russia in the Mediterranean.\nAs with trade, the statistics for its FDI do not indicate that Russia is using investment as a major economic tool of influence in the Mediterranean, whose countries looking for investment are likely to link their economies to more active partners. Russian firms invest abroad at a lower rate compared to their country’s GDP than U.S. ones do (see Figure 12). This rate has grown since 2013 but not consistently. It is also misleading as an overall indicator, as between 40–50 percent of total Russian FDI is in Cyprus, leaving little to invest elsewhere, although some of this money does leave Cyprus for other destinations.\nOther than in Cyprus, Russian FDI in most Mediterranean countries is tiny, even when compared to the size of the host economies, and is dwarfed in almost all cases by U.S. and EU investment. One notable exception to this, however, is Montenegro. In 2019, Russia was the largest foreign investor in the country, with its total investment equaling 26 percent of the country’s GDP, down from a peak of 33 percent in 2015. This investment is concentrated in real estate and tourism infrastructure.61 Tourism generally accounts for 20 percent of Montenegro’s annual GDP, and a visa-free regime allows Russians to be the largest source of tourists to the country. As of 2020, however, Russians are not heavily invested in other industries. In 2005 Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska’s Central European Aluminium Company bought the Podgorica Aluminium Plant, at that time the largest employer in the country, which then went bankrupt in 2008.62 This lack of industrial investment contrasts sharply with newer Chinese investment in Montenegro, which is focused on highway construction and the rehabilitation of a thermal power plant, allowing China to overtake Russia as the largest investor in the country in 2020.63 Even at its peak, however, the high level of Russian investment in Montenegro was unable to influence its geopolitical direction—despite Moscow’s attempt to foment a coup in 2016, the country has joined NATO and it has also stood with Ukraine in its conflict with Russia.64 If Russia’s outsized importance for Montenegro’s economy could not change the country’s policy orientation, Russian FDI is unlikely to be a significant source of leverage in other countries of the region.\n\nOfficial development assistance is not a major tool of Russian policy in the Mediterranean. The Soviet Union was masterful at using its large development assistance budget to exercise influence abroad: for example, to shape votes at the United Nations or to support ideologically compatible countries.65 After the breakup of the Soviet Union, economic collapse in the 1990s turned Russia into a net recipient of financial aid, rather than a donor. This situation was reversed in the mid-2000s, when booming energy export revenues allowed it to once again join the ranks of donor nations.66\nAs with other donor nations, Russia supplies the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) with data on its assistance, but this data is not as complete as that provided by others. Still, the data gives some insights into its development assistance. In 2018, the latest year for which detailed data is available, 68 percent of Russia’s $628 million in bilateral aid was in the form of debt relief, with only 25 percent as “country programmable aid,” or the type of assistance that is directed at specific programs and projects. By comparison, the average for country programmable aid among OECD members was 49 percent. In 2018, of all Mediterranean countries only Syria and the West Bank and Gaza were listed as receiving any Russian aid, each with $2 million (see Figure 13). By not providing them with more development assistance, Russia is missing an opportunity to build goodwill in the countries on the eastern and southern shores of the Mediterranean, especially as they need economic development more than they need the weapons systems it does provide them with and that only perpetuate the region’s conflicts.\n\nRussia does not appear to be using the traditional forms of economic statecraft to build influence in the Mediterranean. Its non-energy trade with the region’s countries is low, its investments in most of them are insubstantial, and it does not give large quantities of development assistance to the countries that need it. The lack of such economic ties is surprising, given Russia’s military and diplomatic efforts to increase its influence in the region.\nRussia has succeeded, however, in using the strengths it does possess—energy resources, weapons industry, and money laundering—to develop some key relationships in the region. In particular, its unique economic tools have helped it manage a difficult relationship with Turkey, which depends on its oil and gas and is a new customer for its nuclear power and weapons systems. These same tools have allowed Russia to build more influence in Egypt, Algeria, and to some degree Cyprus over the last decade. If Russia’s ambitions in the region are limited to maintaining access, currying favor with key decisionmakers, and remaining a nuisance to NATO, then its current level of economic ties is likely sufficient for these goals. If Russia aims to grow its influence and clout with more countries in the region, however, its current economic tool kit does not appear to be large or sophisticated enough to achieve this.\nEconomic statecraft is an important tool in any country’s foreign policy. Trade and investment deals link countries together in vital ways to grow living standards for the people of each country. They also build relationships between people—politicians, business leaders, students—that promote mutual understanding and respect for each other’s cultures. The United States and Europe have generally excelled in building these types of economic ties, and economic data show they continue to be the dominant economic powers in the Mediterranean, with wide-ranging and diverse ties. Sustaining this leading economic position will likely ensure that Russian influence in the Mediterranean remains a manageable, if persistent, problem for the West.\nThe author is a visiting scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and a foreign service officer at the U.S. Department of State.

  "Egypt enrolls Russian imams in 'fatwa training program' to combat Brotherhood - Al-Monitor: The Pulse of the Middle East",
  "\nEgypt enrolls Russian imams in 'fatwa training program' to combat Brotherhood\n\nCAIRO — Egypt has recently stepped up its support for Russia in the fight against extremist ideologies and groups, most notably the Muslim Brotherhood. On Aug. 3, Egypt’s Dar al-Ifta (the Egyptian authority responsible for issuing religious edicts) announced the graduation of 21 imams from Russia from a training camp on the issuance of fatwas against extremist ideologies.\nDar al-Ifta said in a report on its portal on the same day that “the training program for Russian imams aims to provide them with the ability to issue fatwas while adhering to the moderate approach of Islam, and to monitor and analyze extremist ideas.”\nIn a statement on Aug. 4, the mufti of Moscow and the chief imam of the Moscow Cathedral Mosque, Ildar Alyautdinov, said, “The fatwa training program has been very beneficial for Russia’s imams. The Egyptian Dar al-Ifta was keen, through this training, to graduate Russian muftis who are well aware of the importance and seriousness of fatwas and the correct methods to issue moderate fatwas.”\nAlyautdinov explained that the graduates of this training program will serve Russian Muslims in various regions and republics across Russia since they were selected from various places covering all Russian republics.\nThe director of the training department at Dar al-Ifta, Amr al-Wardani, noted in a press statement on Aug. 3 that the training program for Russian imams included 20 sessions, with two sessions per day over the course of 10 days. He indicated the training curriculum included sciences related to the formation of the mufti at the Sharia and civil levels to reflect the image of moderate and tolerant Islam.\nThe Dar al-Ifta training program included one Russian woman named Kavalova Elina who works as a Sharia researcher. She was trained on confronting extremist ideas among Russian female citizens.\nEgypt and Russia share a hostile stance against the Muslim Brotherhood. Both countries have listed it as a banned terrorist group. The Russian ambassador to Cairo, Georgy Borisenko, had said in a press statement back in June 2020 that “the Muslim Brotherhood has been banned in Russia since 2004, well before Egypt did.”\nHe asserted that the Brotherhood cannot carry out any events in Russia and will be dealt with according to the criminal law if it does.\nIn December 2013, Egypt declared the Muslim Brotherhood a legally prohibited terrorist group.\nMuslims in Russia number around 20 million out of the country’s total population of 146 million citizens.\nMeanwhile, the Spiritual Administration of Muslims of Russia is working to confront extremism and extremist groups in Russia. It issued more than 50 books to confront the danger of extremism and respond to extremist groups in the country.\nIn December 2020, Egypt’s Grand Mufti Shawki Allam signed with the Spiritual Administration of Muslims of Russia a memorandum of understanding and cooperation between the two countries. Allam explained back then that “the agreement aims to form partnerships to spread moderation and combat extremist ideology, publish and translate books, and hold scientific meetings aimed to confront the ideology of extremism and terrorism.”\nIn the same month, the Egyptian Dar al-Ifta organized its first online training course for Russian imams and members of the Council of Muftis in Russia. The two-day training also aimed to confront extremism and radical ideas espoused and spread by extremist groups in Russia.\nMore recently, on July 29, the Russian Cultural Center in Egypt organized a symposium to combat extremist ideology. It was attended by a number of scholars of Dar al-Ifta and a Russian religious delegation. At the conclusion of the symposium, Alyautdinov said extremism in Egypt is similar to that existing in Russia. He stressed that there is a cooperation protocol with Egypt’s Al-Azhar to fight extremism in both countries.\nHisham Abdel Aziz, secretary-general of the Egyptian Supreme Council for Islamic Affairs, who also attended the symposium, said the symposium is the outcome of cooperation between Egyptian and Russian scholars in order to combat extremist ideology and spread moderate thought.\nIn early 2019, Al-Azhar expressed its readiness to provide scholarships and training camps for imams and preachers from Russia. In a meeting back then with a delegation from the members of the Russian Muftis Shura Council, Al-Azhar Undersecretary Sheikh Saleh Abbas praised the strong relationship between Russia and Egypt. He stressed his country’s readiness to provide all means of support for Muslims in Russia, whether through scholarships or Al-Azhar Academy for training imams and preachers to confront extremism.\nAmr Eldeeb, a professor at the Institute of International Relations and World History at the Russian Lobachevsky University, told Al-Monitor Russia has had its shares of terrorist and extremist operations and has great experience in dealing with extremist groups in general.\n“Russia is one of the first countries in the world to put the Muslim Brotherhood on the list of banned organizations,” Eldeeb noted. “Russian security leaders are well aware of the danger the group poses on security and stability.”\nHe argued that sending Russian imams to study in countries that adopted radical Salafi thought contributed to the spread of extremist ideology in Russia. “These imams returned to their homeland imbued with extremist ideas that Russia is trying to fight,” he said.\nEldeeb added, “Russia made a shift by sending its Muslim students to study at Al-Azhar in Egypt. It wants to benefit from the moderation of Al-Azhar. This falls in the best interests of both Cairo and Moscow in their war against terrorist and extremist ideology, most notably the Brotherhood ideology.”\nSheikh Khaled Emran, secretary-general for fatwas at Dar al-Ifta, told Al-Monitor, “The training programs for Russian imams focus on a primary goal, which is to promote moderate discourse and the foundations of coexistence in society, and to discuss and monitor extremist ideas.”\nEmran added, “The Russian imams have been trained to acquire the skill of responding to, confronting and refuting these extremist ideas.”\n“The training of Russian imams included female participants. The Islamic religion believes in gender equality when it comes to receiving knowledge. If a woman rises to the fore in preaching and issuing fatwas, she must be equipped with the skills to respond to religious women-related inquiries,\" he said.\n© 2021 Al-Monitor, LLC.

  "Watch CBSN Live\nRussia sees COVID cases skyrocket as many refuse vaccine, or lie about getting it\n\n                      By Mary Ilyushina\n                  \n\nJuly 15, 2021 / 5:14 AM\n          / CBS News\n        \nMoscow — Russia is battling a deadly third wave of coronavirus infections. For days, the country has reported record numbers of daily deaths, and hospitalizations are skyrocketing thanks in part to the spread of the highly infectious Delta variant. \nOn Thursday, Russia reported 25,293 new infections, and it set a grim new record for daily deaths with 791 confirmed fatalities. Overall, Russia has officially identified more than 5.8 million COVID-19 cases since the pandemic began.\nBut despite an official ban on mass gatherings and other restrictions, many Russians are either ignoring or cheating on the rules. Videos have showed young people enjoying large parties.\nA fan zone set up for people to watch the Euro 2020 soccer game in St. Petersburg led to a massive spike in cases in neighboring Finland after fans returned home.\nRussia's voluntary vaccine rollout has been painfully slow and authorities are now making it mandatory for certain workers to get shots.\n\"We see that the campaign is picking up steam and here in the last week we have three times more people getting vaccinated than before,\" Natalya Kuzenkova, the head doctor at Clinic No 68 in Moscow, told CBS News. \nPeople are being given the Russian-made Sputnik V vaccine, which has been widely available since December, but only 15% of Russians have had at least a first dose thus far.  \nAuthorities have blamed everything from Russian nihilism to the sense of freedom that developed following the collapse of the Soviet Union for the shortcomings of the vaccine rollout. But surveys from independent pollsters show that mistrust of the government, and of its approval procedure for vaccines in particular, has grown so wide that a majority of Russians still say they don't want to get vaccinated. \n\"Why would I get vaccinated?\" one man with fairly typical views told CBS News. \"I'm a healthy man and never got sick, so I don't need it… If I get sick then I get sick, what's the difference? That's my personal choice.\"\nThat reluctance, as well as the government's move to mandate vaccination for many people, has led to a booming black market for fake vaccine certificates.   \nOne man being held by authorities for selling fake certificates said he had been delivering them since April. He made hundreds of them in a tiny office that was raided as part of a sting operation by law enforcement agencies, which have launched a nationwide crackdown.\nFor about $100, authorities say criminals will ensure that the vials containing a client's allocated vaccine doses are simply poured out, while they're given fake certificates and are added to the official registry of vaccinated citizens, allowing them access to workplaces and restaurants. \nRussian president Vladimir Putin's own inoculation has been shrouded in secrecy, but he recently claimed that he was given Russia's domestically produced Sputnik V vaccine, and he's pleaded with other Russians to do the same.\n\"The only way to prevent the further spread of the epidemic is through vaccination,\" Putin said recently. \"I hope that the prejudice among some of our citizens will recede as vaccination goes on.\"\nIf the government can convince more Russians to get vaccinated, the next problem facing the country could be widespread supply shortages. \nLast week, Moscow ran out of doses of two of the three approved vaccines, and several other regions across the country have also reported shortages.\n\nFirst published on July 15, 2021 / 5:14 AM\n\n\n© 2021 CBS Interactive Inc.

  "How OLD is Russia? - Russia Beyond",
  "How OLD is Russia?\n\nJust like a Phoenix, Russia has risen from the ashes multiple times. Hence the confusion many have when asked how old Russia actually is. The key to this question lies in a different one: Exactly which Russia are we talking about?\nThe Red Square in Moscow in August 1991.\nA brief period of chaotic power struggle in the political corridors of Moscow in the late 1980s and early 1990s resulted in the official dissolution of the USSR in 1991.\nRussia Day, a public holiday celebrated annually on June 12, commemorating the adoption of the Declaration of State Sovereignty of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic is oftentimes confused with the birthday of the modern, post-Soviet, Russian state. However, it’s misleading to track the existence of the modern Russian state to the declaration adopted on June 12, 1990.\nAlthough the document paved the way for the dissolution of the Soviet Union by establishing the priority of Russian laws over the laws of the USSR, the actual emergence of the modern Russian state happened only a year later, when the Russian Parliament announced the country would be called ‘Russia’ or the ‘Russian Federation’ and the USSR officially disintegrated on December 25, 1991.\nHence, the modern Russian state turned 30 in 2021.\n\nDespite a relatively recent reset of its life clock, the Russian statehood is actually much older than 30. For 69 years before the emergence of Russia as a modern and independent state, the country — albeit with a different name — was a part of the Soviet Union, along with other states, members of the communist alliance.\nIn that capacity, Russia existed from December 30, 1922, and up until the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. And before the Soviet Union was fully and officially formed, Russia existed in the form of The Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR), which was not yet a part of the USSR. In that capacity, Russian statehood has existed since 1917.\nAdding the number of years Russia existed as the RSFSR within and outside of the USSR with the number of years Russia existed as a modern independent state makes Russia 104 years old in 2021.\nGrand Duke of Moscow Ivan III.\nThe often romanticized time of the Russian Empire ended with the revolution in 1917, but it had been around for quite some time. It’s known that Peter the Great proclaimed the emergence of the Russian Empire — and himself as its Emperor — in 1721.\nBut even before that, the Russian state existed in a different form, as the Tsardom of Russia was formed under the rule of Ivan the Terrible in 1547. \nThis is not to mention the formation of the Grand Duchy of Moscow in 1263. Ivan III, who ruled this political entity from 1462, assumed the title of the Grand Prince of all Rus’.\nAdd this into the equation and Russia turned 758 in 2021.\nReproduction of the painting \"Grandchildren of Gostomysl: Rurik, Truvor, Sineus\" by artist Ilya Glazunov.\nOfficially, however, it is agreed to trace the emergence of Russian statehood as far back as to the 9th century. Back then — according to the Primary Chronicle — Varangian prince Rurik was called upon by the Finnic and Eastern Slavic peoples of the Northwestern lands to rule over them. He settled in Novgorod in 862 and, thus, launched the first official Russian statehood. \nObviously, for Rurik to be summoned, there must have been people who would have sent for him and his entourage to show up. People had lived on these lands before the Rurikids dynasty was established, however, it is universally accepted to trace back the emergence of the Russian statehood to 862, nonetheless.\nSo, the next time someone asks you how old Russia is, you now know it turns 1159 in 2021... or does it?\n\n        \tIf using any of Russia Beyond's content, partly or in full, always provide an active hyperlink to the original material. \n        \nSubscribe\nto our newsletter!\nGet the week's best stories straight to your inbox\nThis website uses cookies.

  "Russia warns US against deploying troops in Central Asia near Afghanistan",
  "Russia warns US against deploying troops in Central Asia near Afghanistan\n MOSCOW (AP) — Russia has strongly warned the United States against deploying its troops in the former Soviet Central Asian nations following their withdrawal from Afghanistan, a senior diplomat said in remarks published on Tuesday.\n Russia’s Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said that Moscow conveyed the message to Washington during Russian President Vladimir Putin’s summit with U.S. President Joe Biden in Geneva last month.\n The warning comes as the U.S. military said last week that 90 percent of the withdrawal of U.S. troops and equipment from Afghanistan is complete. Biden said the U.S. military mission in Afghanistan will conclude on Aug. 31.\n “I would emphasize that the redeployment of the American permanent military presence to the countries neighboring Afghanistan is unacceptable,” Ryabkov said. “We told the Americans in a direct and straightforward way that it would change a lot of things not only in our perceptions of what’s going on in that important region, but also in our relations with the United States.”\n He added that Russia has also issued the warning to Central Asian nations.\n “We cautioned them against such steps, and we also have had a frank talk on the subject with our Central Asian allies, neighbors and friends and also other countries in the region that would be directly affected,” Ryabkov said in an interview published in the Mezhdunarodnaya Zhizn magazine.\n On Monday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov emphasized that Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan are all members of the Collective Security Treaty Organization, and any presence of foreign troops on their territories must be endorsed by the security pact. He added that none of those countries have raised the issue.\n Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan both host Russian military bases. Kyrgyzstan, which hosted a U.S. military base that supported operations in Afghanistan, closed it in 2014.\nGet the military's most comprehensive news and information every morning.\nFor more newsletters click here\n Fear of missing out?\nSign up for the Early Bird Brief - a daily roundup of military and defense news stories from around the globe.\n Thanks for signing up. \nBy giving us your email, you are opting in to the Early Bird Brief.\n Uzbekistan, which also hosted a U.S. base, ordered it shut in 2005 amid tensions with Washington. Uzbekistan’s Defense Ministry reaffirmed in May that the country’s constitution and its military doctrine rule out the presence of any foreign troops on its territory.\n “I don’t think that the emergence of new American military facilities in Central Asia would promote security in the region,” Lavrov said.\n The Biden administration has reportedly considered Uzbekistan and Tajikistan that border Afghanistan, as well as Kazakhstan, as possible staging areas for monitoring and quickly responding to possible security problems that may follow the U.S. military’s withdrawal from Afghanistan.\n “I don’t think that anyone is interested in becoming a hostage to such US policy and intentions, and in inviting retaliation,” Lavrov said.\n The Russian foreign minister questioned what results would be achieved with a small U.S. presence outside Afghanistan when a 100,000-strong NATO force inside the country “failed to do anything.”\n “Most probably, they simply want to ensure their military presence in Central Asia and be able to influence the situation in this region.”\n As the American and NATO troops were swiftly pulling out, the Taliban have made quick gains across the country. They claimed on Friday that they now control 85% of Afghanistan’s territory.\n Russian officials have expressed concern that the Taliban surge could destabilize Central Asia.\n Taliban advances already have forced hundreds of Afghan soldiers to flee across the border into Tajikistan which called up 20,000 military reservists to strengthen its southern border with Afghanistan.\n Last week, a senior Taliban delegation visited Moscow to offer assurances that the insurgents’ advances in Afghanistan do not threaten Russia or its allies in Central Asia.\n\n\n\n\n",
  "Russian Disinformation Targets Vaccines and the Biden Administration - The New York Times",
  "Advertisement\nSupported by\nRussian Disinformation Targets Vaccines and the Biden Administration\nA new campaign appears to be spreading falsehoods about the potential for forced inoculations against Covid-19.\nBy Julian E. Barnes\nThe cartoon posted on the far-right discussion forum showed police officers wearing Biden-Harris campaign logos on bulletproof vests and battering down a door with a large syringe. A caption read in part, “In Biden’s America.”\nThe cartoon appears to be an example of the latest effort in Russian-aligned disinformation: a campaign that taps into skepticism and fears of coronavirus vaccination to not just undermine the effort to immunize people but also try to falsely link the Biden-Harris administration to the idea of forced inoculations. The image was one of several spotted by Graphika, a company tracking disinformation campaigns.\nBoth Russia and China have worked to promote their own vaccines through messaging that undermines American and European vaccination programs, according to the State Department’s Global Engagement Center. But in addition to overt messaging promoting their own vaccines, Moscow has also spread conspiracy theories. Last year, the department began warning about how Russia was using fringe websites to promote doubts around vaccinations.\nIt is difficult to quantify the amount of disinformation being produced at any time by the Russians or other adversarial powers, government officials and outside experts said. But the rise of the Delta variant of the coronavirus — and shifting scientific advice on how to defend against a more infectious strain and the need for booster shots or masks — has created an atmosphere for misinformation to more easily spread, experts said.\n“Disinformation thrives in an information vacuum,” said Lisa Kaplan, the chief executive of the Alethea Group, which helps corporations guard against misinformation. “That is when disinformation can really take hold. And knowing how the Russians typically play those situations, it wouldn’t surprise me they are trying to take advantage of it.”\nThe aim of various Russian groups continues to be to exacerbate tensions in Western societies, a key foreign policy goal of Moscow, according to American officials briefed on the disinformation efforts.\nThe Russian and Chinese disinformation has tried to magnify the potential side effects of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, suggesting that the mRNA technology they are based on is untested or risky, State Department officials said this week.\nIn recent weeks, the nature of Russian disinformation has also begun to shift, some officials and outside experts said. Recent postings spreading false information have suggested that the Biden administration is intent on mandating that Americans get vaccines that are failing against the coronavirus.\nThe campaign also comes as President Biden warned President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia last month to rein in ransomware attacks emanating out of Russia and aimed at critical American infrastructure. Though the ransomware attacks are separate from the disinformation campaigns, the warning was the latest effort by United States officials to prod Russia to rein in destructive digital incursions.\nThe Biden administration is actively monitoring Russian misinformation and is trying to counter it by encouraging the public to get vaccinated and promoting the safety and efficacy of Western vaccines, according to an administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss potentially sensitive information.\nWhile some of the messaging posted on social media from Russian state-media accounts aims at a potentially wide audience, some of the most audacious disinformation postings have been aimed at much smaller, far-right audiences.\nGraphika has tracked disinformation that is probably spread by a group affiliated with people who used to work with the St. Petersburg-based Internet Research Agency, which propagated disinformation during the 2016 election. The group has posted cartoons on Patriots.win, a message board featuring far-right politics.\nA recent spate of anti-vaccination cartoons appears to have been spread by the same people involved in a fake media outlet linked to veterans of the Internet Research Agency, said Jack Stubbs, Graphika’s director of investigation.\nWhile the group advances Moscow’s strategic narratives, it is unclear what precise ties, if any, it has to the Russian government.\nIn another cartoon that appears to be the work of the organization, a group of people that the caption suggests might be Texas Democratic legislators reached toward Vice President Kamala Harris in a menacing way.\n“We just looking for some democracy,” says one in the group.\n“*Cough*. Don’t worry! We took Pfizer shots,” says another.\n“To hell with your Pfizer shots,” the cartoon figure of Ms. Harris responds, “I don’t want to get sick.”\nThe title of the cartoon on the far-right discussion forum suggested the Texas Democrats had given Ms. Harris the virus even though she had been vaccinated. The Texans had gone to Washington last month in an attempt to block voting legislation that they said would disenfranchise minority groups. While in the capital, the group met with Ms. Harris, and several tested positive for the coronavirus, but there is no evidence the vice president became ill.\nThe grammatical errors in the cartoon, according to Graphika, are similar to those sometimes made by native Russian speakers writing in English. And the technique of targeting audiences with inflammatory messages around existing social tensions and rifts has long been a hallmark of groups linked to the Internet Research Agency.\n“That’s exactly again what they appear to be doing around Covid,” Mr. Stubbs said. “Rather than promote the Russian vaccine or denigrate a Western vaccine, they’re using this as an opportunity to criticize Biden, primarily, and say the Biden administration has been failing and they haven’t been managing the pandemic properly.”\nTheir use of far-right message boards, including Patriots.win, was earlier reported by Graphika and Reuters.\nMuch of the disinformation efforts are posted on websites with little to no moderation. Patriots.win, which bills itself as a forum supportive of Donald J. Trump, began on Reddit before it was kicked off. From Patriots.win, some of the material attributed to foreign disinformation campaigns have migrated to larger sites with right-wing audiences like Gab and Parler.\nThe moderators of Patriots.win responded to a request for comment with an anti-gay slur and suggested, perhaps facetiously, that Chinese organizations were posting material but routing it through Russia to fool journalists.\nMeasuring the impact of the disinformation efforts is difficult, given the deep divisions over vaccinations that already exist in the United States and Europe; exploiting splits among Americans is a typical Russian tactic. Even on the hard-right discussion forums, some users have fingered the cartoons as being Russian in origin, though the postings have continued.\nBut the Russian messaging has shifted not just on the far-right sites. Similarly, the Alliance for Securing Democracy, a nonprofit group focused on disinformation, has tracked a change in what the Russian state-run media has been producing.\nEarlier, forums like RT, a Kremlin-backed English-language site, were focused on promoting Russia’s vaccine and denigrating Western vaccines. But more recently, Russia’s state-run media has been “really leaning into the culture war debates over vaccine and mask mandates,” said Bret Schafer, a disinformation expert at the Alliance for Securing Democracy.\nRussia uses RT and other state-controlled media to amplify American and international skeptics of vaccines and mask mandates, according to an American official.\nRT has published articles highlighting athletes who are resisting pressure to get vaccinated. It has also suggested liberals were taking at face value Donald Trump Jr.’s facetious remark that vaccinations could be required to vote. And it has published essays aimed at exacerbating divisions over mask requirements.\nThe efforts are not just targeting Americans, Mr. Shafer said. RT’s German-language YouTube feed has focused on public resistance to vaccines. “They’re hitting the same notes,” he said, “with most of their Western propaganda outlets.”\nSheryl Gay Stolberg contributed reporting.\nAdvertisement",

  "Opinion | Trying to pry Russia away from China is a fool’s errand - The Washington Post",
  "Opinion: Trying to pry Russia away from China is a fool’s errand\nPresident Biden has rightly made competing with China his top foreign policy priority. In its first major policy document, the Biden administration stated that China “is the only competitor potentially capable of combining its economic, diplomatic, military, and technological power to mount a challenge to a stable and open international system.” In his address to a joint session of Congress, Biden said, “We’re in competition with China and other countries to win the 21st century.” With Biden in attendance, a NATO summit communique stated for the first time that the rise of China “has security implications for all allies.” So for this administration, and many more to come, formulating effective strategies for addressing China’s rise will remain the focal point of U.S. foreign policy, not unlike the central role that the Soviet Union played for U.S. strategists during the Cold War.\nCertain lessons from the Cold War, therefore, are worth studying and repeating for dealing with China today. Others are not. One successful Cold War play not worth running again is trying to peel Russia away from China.\nAbstractly, the idea of pulling Russia toward the United States to balance against China sounds appealing. It’s classic realpolitik logic. Along these lines, Daniel Yergin recently praised U.S. flexibility on sanctions toward the German-Russian Nord Stream 2 pipeline as a possible “olive branch” that would encourage Russia to distance itself from China, in what is described as “a priority strategy for this administration.”\nYergin’s outlook gives voice to a sentiment many self-described realists — sometimes publicly, often privately — express: Because President Richard M. Nixon succeeded in moving the People’s Republic of China away from the Soviet Union during the Cold War, Biden should today attempt to pull Russia toward the United States and away from China. Conveying this strategy most comprehensively, an anonymous government official recently argued, “the United States must rebalance its relationship with Russia whether it likes it or not. . . . It is in the United States’ enduring interest to prevent further deepening of the Moscow-Beijing entente.”\nThe current Sino-Russian partnership is worrying, and the impulse to view all other foreign policy issues through the U.S.-China bilateral lens is tempting. But this particular Cold War play won’t work today — and even if it did, it would not yield the same benefits that it produced last century.\nAdvocates of the “Nixon-goes-to-China” strategy forget the essential precondition for its success: the Sino-Soviet split. Following a honeymoon after Mao Zedong seized power in 1949, the two communist regimes soon manifested a serious doctrinal divergence, which accelerated after Joseph Stalin’s death and what Beijing labeled as Nikita Khrushchev’s revisionist ways. In 1969, the two countries even fought a short border war. By the time national security adviser Henry Kissinger made his first secret visit to Beijing in 1971, he did not need to convince Premier Zhou Enlai to distance China from Moscow; that divorce had occurred long before.\nBy contrast, Chinese-Russian economic, security and ideological ties today are closer than ever. Vladimir Putin frames international politics in ideological terms: autocrats versus democrats. He sees Xi Jinping as his most important ideological partner, while Xi, in turn, has called Putin his “best friend.” So why would Putin abandon his autocratic soul mate to flirt with a democratic leader he’s met only twice? Moreover, the United States is a democracy, giving other actors — especially Congress — a say in foreign policy decision-making, particularly regarding human rights. In Putin’s view, Xi is a powerful, more reliable partner — in ways that Biden and his successors can never be.\nEven if such a policy shift succeeded, rapprochement with Putin’s Russia would bring few benefits and many disadvantages. What concretely could the United States gain in its competition with China by having Russia on our side? The answer is not much. China needs Russia’s energy exports, while the United States does not. Beyond what’s in place now, Putin will never deploy additional Russian soldiers, missiles or ships to contain China in Asia. Maybe Putin could help isolate Xi at the U.N. Security Council and other international forums, but ultimately Beijing has its own veto.\nSecond, in return for pivoting, Putin would demand unsavory concessions, especially regarding Ukraine and Georgia. That’s a bad trade. A return to sphere-of-influence geopolitics — pro-Putin pundits sometimes call it Yalta 2.0 — hurts the long-term interests of the United States and our European allies.\nMost detrimentally, closer relations with a Russian autocrat to help contain a Chinese autocrat will undermine Biden’s aspiration to unite the free world, about which he has spoken so passionately in the last six months. Biden’s professed global goals to fight corruption and support democracy would look hypocritical if he even toyed with rapprochement with a corrupt dictator in Moscow. Some of the United States’ most embarrassing and costly mistakes during the Cold War came from its toleration — and, in some cases, its outright embrace — of strongmen, generals, theocrats and apartheid in the name of containing the Soviet Union.\nSomeday, the United States should seek deeper partnership with Russia in containing and competing with China. But that policy should be initiated with a democratic Russia, not an autocratic Putin — however far in the future that moment might be.\nRead more:\nHenry Olsen: China and Russia’s proposed lunar research station is an ominous sign for the West\nDavid Ignatius: How Russia and China are attempting to rewrite cyberworld order\nMichael McFaul: How we should measure the success of Biden’s summit with Putin\nIsaac Stone Fish: Why does everyone assume that Russia and China are friends?\nGeorge F.

  "Russia rocket mishap briefly nudges International Space Station out of position\nAfter several ‘hiccups’ on the journey to the ISS, the Nauka lab module accidentally fired its rockets after docking\nLast modified on Fri 30 Jul 2021 16.42 BST\nRussia’s troubled Nauka laboratory module has caused a fright when its rockets accidentally fired after docking the with the International Space Station, briefly throwing the station out of position.\nA few hours after docking, Nauka’s propulsive devices unexpectedly fired, forcing personnel aboard the ISS to fire thrusters on the Russian segment of the station to counter the effect.\n\nThe module started firing “inadvertently and unexpectedly, moving the station 45 degrees out of attitude,” Nasa said on Twitter. “Recovery operations have regained attitude and the crew is in no danger.”\nRussia’s Roscosmos space agency attributed the issue to Nauka’s engines having to work with residual fuel in the craft, Tass news agency reported.\nThe mission comes after more than a decade of delays and as Russia seeks to boost its space industry, which has fallen behind since the collapse of the Soviet Union and struggles to keep up with competition from the United States.\nThe Nauka module blasted off last week from the Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, carried by a Russian Proton rocket, and represents Russia’s first docking of an ISS module in 11 years.\nEarlier, Roscosmos showed the new addition to its segment of the ISS docking with the nadir (Earth-facing) port of the Zvezda service module at 1329 GMT. “There is contact!!!” Roscosmos chief Dmitry Rogozin tweeted.\nIt will now take several months and multiple spacewalks to fully integrate the module with the space station.\nLead MLM Flight Director Greg Whitney and I split the shift today. Never have I ever: 1)been prouder of the team that sits in MCC and lives on @Space_Station, 2)had to declare a spacecraft emergency until now, 3)been so happy to see all solar arrays + radiators still attached. https://t.co/Bmox4WVZsn\nThe launch was closely watched by the European Space Agency because the module was travelling with the European Robotic Arm, the first robot arm that will be able to work on Russia’s ISS segment.\nNauka – which means “science” in Russian – will be primarily used for research and storing laboratory equipment. It will also provide more storage space, new water and oxygen regeneration systems and improved living conditions for cosmonauts of the Russian ISS sector.\nThe Nauka multipurpose laboratory module was conceived as early as the mid-1990s when it was intended as a back-up for the Russian control module Zarya.\nIt was later repurposed as a science module but joined a lineup of stagnating Russian space projects that have fallen victim to funding problems or bureaucratic procedures.\nThe launch of the 20-tonne Nauka – one of the largest modules on the ISS – was initially scheduled for 2007 but has been repeatedly delayed over various issues.\nWhile last week’s launch was successful, Nauka experienced several “hiccups in orbit” during its eight-day journey to the ISS, the European Space Agency said.\n“We won’t lie … We had to worry for the first three days,” Rogozin told journalists after Nauka had docked, according to the RIA Novosti news agency.\nNauka replaces the long-serving Pirs docking module, which joined the ISS in 2001 as a temporary addition but ended up staying in service for two decades.\nMaking room for Nauka, Pirs detached from the ISS earlier this week, its burnt-up remains falling into the Pacific Ocean.\nLaunched in 1998 and involving Russia, the United States, Canada, Japan, and the European Space Agency, the ISS is one of Russia’s few remaining collaborations with the west. \nIn April, Russia said it was considering withdrawing from the ISS programme citing ageing infrastructure, and is planning to launch the first core module of a new orbital station in 2025.\nRussia has announced a series of projects in recent years, including a mission to Venus and a station on the moon, but as the Kremlin diverts funding to military ventures, analysts question the feasibility of these ambitions.\nWith Agence France-Presse and Reuters",

  "Why Russia's COVID deaths are peaking a year after its vaccine was approved - CNET",
  "\n            Why Russia's COVID deaths are peaking a year after its vaccine was approved\n          \n\n            Sputnik-V was the first vaccine in the world to be greenlit, yet under 20% of Russians are fully vaccinated.\n          \nUlyana was in the middle of a haircut when it happened. Sitting inside a St. Petersburg beauty salon, she was chatting with other customers when the topic of vaccines came up. One women declared that she refused to be the Russian government's lab rat, and the other women murmured in agreement. Ulyana then told her hairdresser, Katya, that she'd gotten the Sputnik-V vaccine and felt fine. \nKatya was shocked. The hairdresser got out her scissors and slowly moved them toward Ulyana's shoulders. She believed Ulyana had a microchip in her shoulder.\n\"I was speechless,\" said Ulyana, a 31-year-old consultant. \"She explained to me that in the videos she had seen on the internet, vaccinated people could stick metal objects like coins to their bodies in the place of injection because the 'vaccine chip' draws them.\"\nThe hairdresser showed Ulyana the Instagram video she'd seen, as well as a Telegram group she subscribed to. The group's members, numbering in the thousands, spoke of how the government would be able to use the vaccine to implant a microchip that would give it the power to control someone \"like a video game character.\"\n\"I have known Katya for a while, and she is a nice girl,\" Ulyana said. \"I have always imagined people who might believe in all those conspiracy theories are weirdos in tinfoil hats. She is a normal person, a working mom with a kid.\" \nRussia has a dreadful vaccine hesitancy problem. Its Sputnik-V vaccine was authorized a year ago, in August 2020, and deployed in December. But nine months later, just 19% of Russians are estimated to be fully vaccinated. The more transmissible delta variant is proving ruinous in the face of such limited defenses. Case numbers are going up, and unlike in the more vaccinated US and UK, deaths are shooting up too. The country recorded 799 deaths on Wednesday, Aug. 11, an all-time high. \nThe official statistics say 164,000 Russians have died from COVID-19 but, with excess deaths standing at 531,000 since the pandemic began, experts analyzing excess mortality data estimate the true death toll could be triple the official count. That Vladimir Putin's administration can't be counted on to provide legitimate COVID numbers is part of the problem: After years of the government sowing disinformation, many Russians don't trust the Kremlin when it tells them to get vaccinated. With so many seeds of distrust planted, conspiracy theories flourish. \nWhen Ulyana was accused by her hairdresser of having a chip in her shoulder, she laughed it off. She tried to tell Katya that the videos were fake. Katya rejected the argument -- instead reasoning that \"they\" switched the chips off after being exposed by the viral videos.\nRussian President Vladimir Putin announced last August, via a Zoom-like teleconference broadcast on state TV, that Sputnik-V had been authorized for deployment.\nWhen Sputnik-V was made available to the Russian public in December, authorities hoped 60% of adults would be vaccinated by July. The failure to reach this milestone doesn't reflect lethargy among Russians. In fact, many Russians have proved remarkably energetic — in their efforts to avoid vaccination.\nThe country is home to a thriving black market for vaccination certificates, which are required for many hospitality, retail and transport employees to return to work. State TV last month warned of a growing trend, evidently spawned by a viral TikTok video, that sees Russians eluding the jab by getting the injection in a prosthetic limb. \nCOVID denialism and vaccine skepticism exist everywhere, but Russia has a unique problem. Much of the population harbors a specific distrust of the Russian-made Sputnik-V vaccine. \n\"Sputnik-V has a horrible reputation in the country,\" said Andrei Soldatov, an author and senior fellow at the Center for European Policy Analysis, a nonprofit public policy group. \"Everybody hates it.\"\nSputnik-V was developed with exceptional speed at Moscow's Gamaleya Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology. Russian scientists had a prototype vaccine in March 2020 before the city even went into lockdown, around a month before the Trump administration accelerated US vaccine production with Operation Warp Speed. It was August 2020 when the Sptunik-V was approved, with Putin assuring the public that the vaccine had \"gone through all the necessary checks.\"\nMany Russians became convinced that authorization of Sputnik-V had more to do with Russia clearing a vaccine before the US than anything else. This is implied by the name: Sputnik is a reference to the satellite the Soviets launched into space, embarrassing the US in the early Cold War years, while the V is for victory. This perception became stronger when Putin was found to be speaking dishonestly. At the time he said Sputnik-V had been clinically verified, Phase III trials, which test the safety and efficacy of a vaccine against a placebo, had yet to even begin. \nThat reputation has stuck, even a year after Sputnik-V was authorized, according to Ekaterina Borozdina, an associate professor in sociology at the European University in St. Petersburg, who's been surveying educated professionals about vaccine hesitancy.\n\"Respondents were concerned that vaccination campaigns are designed to reach some state-level goals, including purely political goals related to a kind of competition with other [countries],\" she said via email, adding that respondents often felt that any health risks associated with taking a vaccine aren't as important to bureaucrats as ratcheting up vaccination statistics.\nThe Kremlin's apparent obsession with vaccine supremacy may have undermined the credibility of what appears to be a legitimate vaccine. Sputnik-V is used not just in Russia, but also in countries like Argentina, Hungary and India, and the Phase III data published in The Lancet medical journal shows a 91.6% efficacy in blocking transmission. (Phase III trials took place prior to the delta variant's spread.)\nIts rapid development can be chalked up to the Gamaleya Institute's expediency: It began working away at a vaccine as soon as scientists released the genome sequence for the coronavirus, in January 2020, and it used as a foundation the work it had already done to craft vaccines for the Ebola virus and the MERS coronavirus. \n\"If you have the [vaccine] platform well established, then it is an easy matter to go from MERS to COVID,\" explained Nikolai Petrovsky, a vaccine researcher and vice president of the International Immunomics Society. \"The published data suggest that Sputnik-V is a reasonable vaccine very similar to AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson Adenovirus vaccines.\n\"But while it might be a good vaccine, people have a right to be skeptical given the absence of reliable data.\"\nEven after it was deployed for widespread use in December, Putin hurt public perception of Sputnik by avoiding vaccination until March. Unusually for a president renowned for ostentatious photo ops, the Kremlin sent out no video or photo of the event. He didn't even say which vaccine he received -- not until two months later, after much questioning, did he reveal it was Sputnik-V.\nA vaccination center in St. Petersburg. \nWhen Russia was found to have systematically doped its Olympic athletes in the run-up to 2014's Sochi Games, the sports minister offered an apology. Later that year he was promoted to deputy prime minister. Ulyana thinks that well-known misdeeds like this hurt the Russian government's credibility, which matters when that same government is beseeching citizens to roll up their sleeves for a vaccine.\n\"It naturally creates a lot of mistrust in the society when people see that our officials face no real consequences even after being called out for their actions by the international community,\" she said. \nThough Sputnik-V supplies have been lacking in parts of Russia, trust appears to be the resource its government needs most to battle COVID-19. The country's population trusts its business, media and government institutions less than any other country's population polled by Edelman for the firm's annual Trust Barometer. Tellingly, just 15% of Russians surveyed last October and November for the 2021 Trust Barometer said they'd get a COVID vaccination as soon as possible, compared with 33% of Americans, 48% of Brazilians and 51% of Indians.\nConspiracy theories have unsurprisingly proliferated in such an atmosphere of mistrust. Among those theories is the belief, shared by 66% of Russians, that COVID-19 was created in a lab as a biological weapon. The conspiracy theory that billionaires like Bill Gates are using the vaccine to reduce the global population to 1 billion is also popular, as is the theory that claims face masks contain infectious \"nanoworms.\" \nThe Kremlin may have inadvertently fueled conspiracy theories about Sputnik-V as it relentlessly spun disinformation about foreign vaccines, which are banned in the country. Facebook has pulled over 300 Russia-linked accounts that were spreading vaccine misinformation. State TV regularly amplifies any misfortunes that befall the small percentage of Pfizer and Moderna recipients who experience side effects, and one of Russia's most famous TV pundits last year denounced AstraZeneca as a \"monkey vaccine\" because Oxford built the vaccine off a variant of COVID that infects chimpanzees. The result may be greater skepticism of vaccines in general, not just Western ones. \nFaced with such ardent suspicion, the Kremlin at first tried to win over Russians with a sweet deal. Governments offered mobile vaccinations, free ice cream or even free money in exchange for vaccinations. Now, with the delta variant running rampant, the Kremlin is making vaccination mandatory for public-facing workers, like hospitality and retail employees. As of late June, Muscovites need to be vaccinated to enter restaurants. \nThe strategy is turning Russian politics on its head, with Putin's usual critics becoming supporters of the Kremlin's vaccine drive. \n\"The most liberal part of the society, which is usually more critical of the government, they are pushing for more [government] control in terms of restrictions,\" said Soldatov of CEPA. \"The rest of the population, which usually is more in favor of the government, they are getting more suspicious of the vaccine.\"\nSeeking solutions, Putin's administration may be looking to introduce more vaccine variety into the country. Last week it approved trials to see how the AstraZeneca vaccine works in tandem with Sputnik-V, indicating it may break its moratorium on international vaccines.\nFor Ulyana, however, the solution isn't more vaccines. It's more honesty.\n\"I wish the authorities could at least acknowledge some of their past mistakes and start an honest dialogue about the issue,\" she said. \"It's really critical. The death rates are the highest since the beginning of the pandemic.\"\nShe's tired of arguing with vaccine deniers, she says. \"Especially when you simply want to get a haircut.\" ",
  "Emissions from Russian Permafrost Could Spike Tenfold if Leaders Ignore UN Climate Report Warning - The Moscow Times",
  "Emissions from Russian Permafrost Could Spike Tenfold if Leaders Ignore UN Climate Report Warning\nRussia’s permafrost could deteriorate fast and spark an accelerating loop of warming if world leaders don’t heed UN climate scientists’ call to drastically cut global carbon emissions, an expert told The Moscow Times.\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report published Monday shows unequivocally that climate change is progressing more quickly than feared — with temperatures already 1 degree Celsius above pre-industrial levels — and that time is running out to prevent catastrophic warming. It expands upon the IPCC’s 2013 climate assessment, which came two years before nearly 200 countries signed the Paris Climate Agreement in hopes of keeping warming below 1.5 C.\n“This IPCC report studies climate feedback effects in much more detail than the previous report,” the World Wildlife Foundation (WWF) Russia’s head of climate and energy research Alexei Kokorin said.\nLarge amounts of carbon are stored within permafrost, the layer of soil that stays frozen year-round and covers nearly 65% percent of Russia’s territory.\nWhile this permafrost doesn’t currently emit much carbon, ​​Kokorin said its emissions could increase tenfold by 2100 if global greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise at their current pace.\nExperts believe that as permafrost melts, it will release an increasing amount of carbon, leading to warming that in turn melts even more permafrost — setting off a cycle of warming nearly impossible to stop.\nKokorin also said Russia can expect to see extreme weather events with increasing frequency, with once-in-a-decade heat waves happening every five years if global temperatures rise 2 C beyond pre-industrial levels and happening nearly every year if the planet warms by 4 C.\n“That could affect whether people will choose to live in Moscow. If a heatwave like the current one happens every five years, you can see it as bearable. But what if it happens almost every year? Would we have to move the Russian capital to another location?” Kokorin said.\nMore detailed information will be available when Russia’s national climate assessment comes out sometime next year, Kokorin said. \nWhile the IPCC report relied mostly on scientific articles published in English, the Russian report will also include a lot of material that hasn’t been translated into English yet, potentially offering a deeper understanding of Russia’s unique climate dynamics.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Moscow Times’ team of journalists has been first with the big stories on the coronavirus crisis in Russia since day one. Our exclusives and on-the-ground reporting are being read and shared by many high-profile journalists.\n                        \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWe wouldn’t be able to produce this crucial journalism without the support of our loyal readers.

  "Data suggests Russia's COVID-19 death toll is far higher than reported - ABC News",
  "Data suggests Russia's COVID-19 death toll is far higher than reported\nData shows a growing gap between the official count and the likely real toll.\nABC News Live Prime: Wednesday, July 28, 2021\nST. PETERSBURG, Russia -- At the start of June, St. Petersburg’s local administration stopped publishing information about how many COVID-19 patients had been hospitalized in the Russian city.\nThe sudden disappearance of the previously daily reported figures happened to coincide with the opening of one the city‘s most prestigious annual events, the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum.\nThe forum, a gathering of Russia’s elite and a showcase for its biggest companies, has become a flagship event under President Vladimir Putin. Over five days, 13,000 people were expected to attend the event, where Putin told the audience that life was \"gradually returning to its normal routine” after the pandemic.\nBut the forum was opening just as St. Petersburg was seeing a terrifying surge in COVID-19 cases, as a third wave fueled in part by the delta variant bore down on the country. The last bulletin before the numbers vanished had shown St. Petersburg hospitalizing 500 people a day -- a record number and one that meant the city would run out of hospital beds within days.\nJournalists and critics of the government quickly started asking if the disappearance of the COVID-19 statistics was connected to holding the forum. St. Petersburg’s administration refused to comment and the latest figures weren't published again until nearly three weeks later. They were no longer updated daily, either.\n\"They need to create the impression that everything is OK,\" said Boris Vishnevsky, an opposition lawmaker from St. Petersburg's city assembly, who also opposed holding the forum. \"They don't care about people's lives and health.\"\nThroughout the pandemic, Russian authorities have been accused of massaging statistics to hide the real scale of the country’s COVID-19 impact. The Kremlin has repeatedly suggested that although it has been difficult, Russia has fared better than most other countries, even as it has neglected to impose tough lockdown measures.\nBut publicly available mortality statistics, as well as other data, show an ever growing, yawning gap between Russia’s official COVID-19 figures and what are likely the far larger real numbers. The data suggest the true death toll may already be over a half-million people. Far from doing better than most, the data suggests that, in reality, Russia has suffered one of the deadliest COVID-19 epidemics in the world.\nThe toll is growing even steeper now as Russia endures a deadly third wave that has remained largely unchecked amid few restrictions and poor vaccination uptake -- the latter caused in part by some of the highest levels of vaccine scepticism in the world.\nRussia’s official COVID-19 death toll, published by the government’s coronavirus task force, currently stands at around 155,000. In total numbers, that still places Russia fourth in the world, behind only Brazil, India and the United States. But, given the size of the country’s 144 million population and the number of cases it has had, that number appears puzzlingly low.\nThere is a consensus among experts internationally that the best method to assess the true toll of the pandemic in Russia is by counting so-called \"excess deaths.\" That is, comparing the total number of deaths from any cause in a country during the pandemic periods with the total number of deaths in an average year.\nAlmost every country hit by the pandemic has seen a steep increase in total deaths compared to the average. Although some of those extra deaths can be attributed to other causes, such as disruption to health systems, most experts believe the vast majority are COVID-19 deaths.\nRussia’s official death toll doesn’t take into account excess deaths, but its national statistics service, Rosstat, has quietly continued to release total mortality data for each month, publishing it in spreadsheets on its website. That has allowed independent demographers and journalists to calculate excess deaths for Russia during the pandemic.\nThe mortality data so far released by Rosstat shows that in 2020, Russia suffered 340,000 more deaths than in 2019. For the first five months of 2021, there were 133,000 more excess deaths.\nThat means Russia has sustained at least 473,000 more deaths during the pandemic than usual, already three times higher than its officially reported toll. That does not yet include June and July, the deadliest months of the current third wave.\n“I think that by the end of September, the overall excess mortality will be at least 700,000 people,” said Alexey Raksha, an independent demographer who previously worked at Rosstat. \"It is a huge number.\"\nBy proportion of the population, the current figures give Russia the highest death toll of any major country in the world and place it in the top five of any country in the world, behind only Peru, Bulgaria, North Macedonia and Serbia, according to a ranking by The Economist tracking excess deaths globally.\n“In November and December of last year, the number of deaths have been record. The biggest in history, in post-war history in Russia,” said Raksha.\nRaksha was fired from his job as a demographer at Rosstat last year after he publicly pointed out the discrepancies in the official COVID-19 statistics. He has accused Russian authorities of crudely manipulating the numbers, which he says is visible in the unnatural anomalies in the data released by the country's coronavirus task force.\nHe points to line graphs showing monthly deaths for Moscow, where steep curves indicating increasing deaths at certain times suddenly flatline and hold steady for several days.\n“It’s in contradiction with all statistical, epidemiological, demographical law,” Raksha said. “It’s just impossible.”\nHe said the sudden plateaus are nicknamed the \"Soybanin’s Shelf,\" referring to Moscow’s Mayor Sergey Sobyanin. He said they were the result of city officials simply putting a limit on the number of deaths that could be published that day.\n“At some point, Sobyanin just ordered not to show more than 75 deaths daily in Moscow. That’s it,” Raksha said.\nRussian health officials have previously said they take a more conservative approach to assessing COVID-19 deaths. But that does not explain the vast difference and, at times, officials have acknowledged the real death toll is substantially higher.\nIn December, Deputy Prime Minister Tatiana Golikova, who oversees the COVID-19 response, acknowledged that around 81% of all excess deaths in Russia were caused by COVID-19. The federal statistics service in June also published an estimate suggesting there had been over 270,000 COVID-19 deaths.\nBut Russia’s primary official death toll, which is most often used internationally and in state media, has not been updated to match those statements.\nA  recent investigation by three independent Russian investigative news sites also found evidence that internal government records show it is also concealing the scale of COVID-19 cases in the country by as much as five times.\nThe sites, Meduza, Kholod and Mediazona, reported that an oversight by Russia’s health ministry in issuing certificates confirming recent COVID-19 patients had inadvertently revealed the ministry has a database containing 29 million recorded COVID-19 cases. The official public count currently only shows six million.\nThe government has denied the reports, but issued conflicting responses, saying the database was not accurate and that it also contained vaccination numbers.\nCritics have said the efforts to make Russia’s bout with the pandemic appear less deadly are making it worse by discouraging people from taking the virus seriously, which they say also hampers its push to vaccinate. Although Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine has been found to be effective, authorities are struggling to persuade Russians to get it.\nWith few restrictions in place and still less than 20% of the population fully vaccinated, doctors in the city told ABC News they feared a fourth wave in the autumn was already inevitable.\n\"Doctors will answer for it, not the government,\" said a paramedic in St. Petersburg, who requested anonymity over concerns she could face retaliation.\nIn St. Petersburg last week, Alexander Yablokov, a 68-year-old soccer manager, said he did not believe the official death toll after he spent three weeks in a COVID-19 hospital. While there, he said he was in a small ward where all but one of seven patients with him died within a week. He said he had pulled his blanket over his head whenever he heard the sound of a gurney coming down the corridor, knowing another of his neighbors had passed.\n“I thought I had found myself in a morgue. Not a hospital but a morgue,” he said\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",

  "Russia bans media outlet that published Vladimir Putin scoops | Russia | The Guardian",
  "Russia bans media outlet that published Vladimir Putin scoops\nProekt outlawed in act of revenge for embarrassing revelations about the president and top Kremlin officials\nLast modified on Tue 20 Jul 2021 14.21 BST\nThe Kremlin’s war on independent journalism in Russia has escalated after the Proekt investigative media outlet was outlawed in an act of revenge for a series of deeply embarrassing revelations about Vladimir Putin and top Kremlin officials.\nThe rare decision to ban a critical media outlet by fiat is a bellwether for Russia’s new wave of investigative news outlets, which compete to publish damaging scoops about top officials and are now bracing for the Kremlin to employ similar pressure on them to shut down.\n\nState media on Thursday announced that Russia’s justice ministry had added Proekt to a list of “undesirable organisations”, meaning its journalists must stop working for the site or face criminal prosecution, and added eight journalists, including Proekt’s editor-in-chief, Roman Badanin, to a register of “foreign agents”. Several reporters for Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty and the Russian news outlet Open Media were also declared foreign agents.\nIt is illegal for other news agencies to link to or directly quote materials from an undesirable organisation, meaning, theoretically, they would have to purge their archives of any reference to Proekt’s work or possibly face criminal charges. The status would also outlaw any efforts by Proekt to crowdfund; their donors could also face charges.\nThe assault on Proekt on critical and independent media in Russia has seen news websites like Meduza and VTimes declared foreign agents (the latter has since shut down), journalists from the student journal DOXA put on trial, the investigative arm of Alexei Navalny’s Anti-Corruption Fund declared “extremist”, and millions sought in fines against the US-funded RFE/RL.\nBut it is the first time that a news outlet has explicitly been banned under the law (the closest example is the closure of the media arm of Mikhail Khodorkovsky’s Open Russia) and appears to indicate how Proekt touched a nerve in the Kremlin by investigating top officials and sensitive subjects like Russia’s bungled Covid-19 response and its deployment of mercenaries to Africa.\nLast week, Badanin and two other employees of Proekt were targeted with house searches by police who said they were investigating a four-year-old slander case. But Proekt’s employees tied the searches to their plans to release a damning investigation into the interior minister, Vladimir Kolokoltsev, which alleged that his family members had become fabulously rich since his appointment in 2012 and that he was suspected of having ties to organised crime.\nProekt has also published investigations into some of Putin’s most feared associates, including Chechnya head Ramzan Kadyrov and the businessman Yevgeny Prigozhin. Using leaked property and passport information, the website also contended in an article last year that Putin had a daughter by a secret mistress.\nFor years, Kremlin-friendly businessmen had bought out or reined in critical outlets, warning journalists not to cross the “double lines” or be fired.\nBut the emergence of new investigative outlets like Proekt, which reduced their footprint in Russia to avoid government pressure, has left the government with fewer tools to control their output besides declaring them foreign agents, bankrupting them, or seeking other ways to close them down.\nProekt did not immediately comment on the government decision on Thursday.\n This article was amended on 20 July 2021 to clarify that the Open Media company referenced here is a Russian news outlet.",

  "How Russian Yasen-Class, US Virginia-Class Attack Submarines Compare",
  "A leading-edge research firm focused on digital transformation.\n\n                Good\n                \n\n\nSubscriber\nAccount active\n                since\n                \n\nHow the US's and Russia's newest attack submarines stack up\nAs the United States has once again shifted its focus to great-power competition with near-peer adversaries, there is now a greater emphasis to \"keep up with the Joneses,\" and while the United States Navy continues to operate the largest number of aircraft carriers, it is in submarines where Russia could have an edge.\nDuring the Cold War, the Soviet Union was unable to match the surface fleet of the United States; however, the Soviet Navy maintained a significantly larger force of submarines.\nNow, as Moscow has put renewed emphasis on its underwater cruisers, the question has been asked how Russia's latest submarines compared to those in service with the US Navy.\nWriting for Naval News, H I Sutton compared the Russian Navy's advanced Project 885M (Yasen-M) nuclear-powered submarines with the US Navy's Block-V Virginia-class submarines.\nWhile the two classes of boats are similar — Sutton noted that the larger Yasen-M are essentially \"cruise missile submarines\" and thus are given the special vessel classification \"SSGN\" instead of the \"SSN.\"\nDeveloped in the late 1980s, the Yasen class was initially intended to replace Russia's aging Akula-class nuclear-powered attack submarines.\nUpgraded after the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Project 885M was heavily updated with design tweaks and performance upgrades. The submarines feature a submerged displacement of 13,800 tons and can reach a maximum speed of up to 35 knots.\nThe Yasen-M also features revamped onboard electronics, a slightly reduced overall length, and reportedly a new KTP-6 rector that is believed to reduce the submarine's noise levels.\nThe nuclear-powered submarines are armed with 3M14K Kalibr-PL (NATO Reporting name SS-N-30A Sizzler) and P-800 (3M55) Oniks (NATO Reporting name SS-N-26 Strobile) cruise missiles as their basic strike weapons, while the Yasen­-M has 32 vertical tubes that can accommodate three missile types. Additionally, the boats could soon be armed with the 3M22 Tsirkon (Zircon) hypersonic anti-ship missile.\nCurrently, there are seven Project 885M submarines in various stages of construction at the Sevmash Shipyard in northwest Russia, and the newly floated out Krasnoyarsk is now on track to be commissioned into the Pacific Fleet sometime next year.\nThat follows the acceptance of the Project 885M lead nuclear-powered submarine Kazan, which was handed over to the Russian Navy on May 7. She is now in active service with the Northern Fleet.\nThe US Navy's Virginia-class nuclear-powered cruise-missile fast-attack submarines (SSNs) were developed to replace the more expensive Seawolf-class while still providing a capable boat to address nautical threats from near-peer adversaries in the 21st century.\nThe boats were designed to operate in both the open-ocean and for littoral missions, including anti-submarine warfare (ASW) and intelligence gathering operations.\nThe Block V variants are larger than the previous versions of the Virginia-class, with the length increased from 377 feet to 460 feet, and with greater displacement from 7,800 tons to 10,200 tons. As a result, the Block V versions of the Virginia-class are the second-largest US submarines produced behind only the Ohio-class.\nThis included the addition of an 83-foot section, which increased the number of missile launch tubes — increasing the number from 12 to 40, which in essence could triple the capacity of short targets for each boat. The boats can carry a total of 66 weapons.\nTo date, 19 of the planned 66 Virginia-class submarines have been completed, while 11 more are now under construction. Ten of those are from the Block IV, while one is from the latest Block V — and that latter boat will feature key improvements that enhance the capabilities of the fast-attack subs.\nFor now, it may be difficult to know which is truly the superior sub.\nAs Sutton noted, \"aspects such as sonar, sensors and stealth are harder to compare given the sensitive nature of these topics.\"\nHowever, each of the classes is believed to be difficult to counter, and each has arsenals of weapons that should be seen as truly deadly.\nPeter Suciu is a Michigan-based writer who has contributed to more than four dozen magazines, newspapers and websites.

  "Russians are winning in Tokyo even though Team Russia is banned from the Olympics",
  "\nSections\nTV\nFeatured\nMore from NBC\n Follow NBC News \nRussians are winning in Tokyo even though Team Russia is banned from the Olympics\nTOKYO — There is a Russian elephant in the room at the Tokyo Olympics.\nTechnically, Russia is officially banned from competing in international sporting events until next year for running a state-sponsored doping program. And yet there are 334 Russian gymnasts, sprinters and other athletes competing openly in Tokyo.\nWith them is a small army of coaches, assistants and others who have not been shy about cheering their team on even though the Japanese — before they declared a state of emergency and banned all fans from the stands — explicitly forbade cheering for fear it could spread Covid-19.\nIn fact, as of Wednesday, the Russian athletes had won 52 medals putting them in third place after China and the United States, according to the latest Olympic medals tally.\nThat they are able to continue adding to Moscow’s medal haul despite not being an official Russian team is due to an enormous loophole that enables them to compete as members of a made-up entity called ROC, which stands for the Russian Olympic Committee.\nAnd that infuriates critics who say the Russians have got a slap on the wrist from an International Olympic Committee that is too afraid to administer a punishment that fits their crime.\n“Back in the days of East Germany, they doped their athletes in every sport except sailing, then known as yachting,” David Wallechinsky, former president of the International Society of Olympic Historians, told NBC News. “The Russians went beyond that: they doped sailors and curlers, of all things.”\n“It was so extensive, it was outrageous,” he said. “When the story came out, it was an enormous scandal and I personally felt that they just should have banned Russia from the Olympics for four years – period.”\nInstead, the IOC imposed a penalty that was “so weak and wimpy that it was painful.”\n“Now you have a situation right here, right now, where the Russians feel, you know, ‘OK, we got away with it. Yeah, some of our athletes went down but we got a bunch more,’” Wallechinsky said. “And frankly, we could do it again and sacrifice more athletes.”\nTravis Tygart, chief executive of the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency, called the IOC penalties on the Russians “a farce.”\n“Unfortunately, we’ve seen this horror film already – where the Russian state-sponsored doping program walks free and Russia wins while the IOC and WADA leaders attempt to pull the wool over the world’s eyes by claiming Russia is 'banned’,” Tygart said, referring to the World Anti-Doping Agency, in an email to Reuters that was published Saturday. \"It is barely a 'rebrand' and will do nothing to stop the corruption in Russia and likely will embolden others willing to win by any means.”\nNBC News has reached out to ROC spokesman Konstantin Vybornov. So far, there has been no reply.\nThe IOC responded with a statement that did not address whether the Russians were being allowed to escape serious punishment, and insisted \"the fight against doping and the protection of clean athletes are top priorities for the IOC.\"\nIOC spokesman Mark Adams has already been on the receiving end of questions from reporters about why the ROC athletes are routinely being referred to as “Russians” by Olympic officials (they’re not supposed to be) and whether the IOC will take steps to de-Russify the references to the ROC ahead of the Beijing Winter Olympics in February.\nROC athletes will be competing there because the ban on Russia is until Dec. 16, 2022.\n“In certain circumstances, we can say ‘Russia Olympic Committee’,” Adams insisted during a press conference last week.\nRussia was officially banned in 2019 from competing in international sporting events for four years after it was caught running a state-sponsored doping program designed to boost its medal haul at international sporting events. The ban was later reduced to two years.\nIn Moscow, their athletes' exploits have been front page news for weeks and they're described as Russian athletes, not ROC athletes.\n“Russian boxer Gadzhimagomedov reaches final in the Olympics and guarantees himself a silver,” was the headline for the top story in Kommersant, a leading Moscow daily newspaper Tuesday.\nWritten like a standard Olympics story, it ended with: “In the team rankings of the Tokyo Olympics, Russia ranks fifth after China, the U.S., Japan and Australia.\"\nNo mention of the ROC.\nSo how does being banned from the Olympics look? For starters, ROC athletes can’t wave the Russian flag and their national anthem isn't played during medal ceremonies.\nThe opening bars of Tchaikovsky’s Piano Concerto No. 1 have been played the dozen times a Russian has won a gold medal at these Games. And the flag they’ve waved is not the Russian flag, but it has an Olympic flame in Russia’s white, blue and red colors, with the Olympic rings beneath them.\nThe ROC athletes are not allowed to have the word Russia emblazoned on their uniforms, unless it’s accompanied by the words “neutral athlete.”\nAnd that’s about it.\nWallechinsky said there is a reason why Russia is being treated with kid gloves by the IOC.\n“The IOC just took the position, I believe, that there are certain countries that are just too important to the Olympic movement to eliminate, Russia being one of them, the United States being one, China being another. My guess, some of the Western European nations would also qualify,” he said.\nTygart insisted he was not painting all the ROC athletes with a broad brush.\n“Of course, it is not fair to call into question any individual athlete’s performance, and all are presumed innocent unless and until proven otherwise,” he said.\nBut the circumstances under which the ROC athletes are competing have raised suspicions among some competitors.\nAfter the U.S. swimmer Ryan Murphy finished second to the ROC swimmer Evgeny Rylov in the 200-meter backstroke Friday, he said, “It’s a huge mental drain on me … that I’m swimming in a race that’s probably not clean.”\n“It frustrates me, but I have to swim the field that’s next to me,” he said.\nMurphy did not name names and Rylov, who was sitting next to him during the press conference, tried to paper the remark over.\n“I have always been for clean competition,” he said. ”From the bottom of my heart, I am for clean sport. I’ve devoted my entire life to this sport. Ryan didn’t accuse me of anything, so I’d rather not comment.”\nThe ROC, however, was furious and blasted Murphy on its official Twitter account.\n“You have to know how to lose,” it said in Russian.\n“But not everyone can. And here we go again — the same old song about Russian doping is played by the old music box. Someone is diligently turning the handle. English propaganda is oozing verbal sweat onto the Tokyo Games. Through the mouths of athletes offended by defeats. We will not console you. We’ll forgive those who are weaker. God is their judge. He’s our helper.”\nCorky Siemaszko reported from Tokyo, and Patrick Smith from London.\nCorky Siemaszko is a senior writer for NBC News Digital.\nPatrick Smith is a London-based editor and reporter for NBC News Digital.\n© 2021 NBC UNIVERSAL",
  "Briton's arrest in Berlin over Russia spying claims shows Cold War is still with us",
  "Briton’s arrest in Berlin over Russia spying claims shows Cold War is still with us\nThe story could have come straight from the pages of John le Carré’s Cold War spy novels.\nAn employee at Britain’s embassy in Berlin has been arrested and accused of selling sensitive documents to the Russians.\nGerman prosecutors say the 57-year-old UK national had been forwarding documents to the intelligence services in Russia since November 2020. British and German authorities were involved in the investigation of the suspect.\nAstonished headlines will warn of a new Cold War. But no one should be surprised, because the Cold War, apart from a brief post-perestroika thaw in the 1990s, never really went away. The trouble is some in the West thought – or hoped – it had.\nBritish man working at UK Embassy in Germany arrested for allegedly spying for Russia\nIn July last year, we finally saw the British government’s long-awaited – and suspiciously delayed – report (its publication was held up for more than six months until after the general election) on the threat posed by Moscow.\nIt revealed the alarming extent to which Britain, gripped by fear of Islamist terrorism, had underestimated the dangers posed by Vladimir Putin’s Russia. The report noted that at the height of the Cold War, GCHQ focused 70 per cent of resources on Soviet Bloc countries. But by 2006 just 4 per cent were devoted to Moscow .\nWith London looking at terrorist threats at home and in the Middle East, the Kremlin was able to carry out assassinations on British soil with chemical weapons, launch cyber attacks, meddle in elections (including the Scottish referendum and the Brexit vote) and buy influence in the UK thanks to its squad of bankers, lawyers and industrialists in “Londongrad”.\nThe Soviet Union’s ideological motives has been replaced by Putin’s more banal ones: revenge, hubris, venality. But the results are similar.\nIt wasn’t as if the signs weren’t already there. We’d seen Russia invade Crimea, kill political opponents at home and abroad, and flex its muscles in the Middle East. The Cold War is back, as the piquant detail of today’s arrest in Berlin show. \nA report in 2018 by think tank the Henry Jackson Society, citing “intelligence sources”, said Russia had as many as 200 intelligence case officers in the UK, with more than 500 agents working for them. In addition, it said that Moscow could call upon informants in the Russian expatriate community, which numbers tens of thousands.\nIn May this year, in recognition of the growing threat, Britain set out plans to crack down on hostile activity by foreign states, with a proposed law to give security services enhanced powers.\nLast month it was reported that Russia and the US were working out a deal to swap spies, in a tactic honed during the Cold War.\nThe first time around, after the Second World War forced the UK’s alliance with the Soviet Union, London underestimated the coming threat from Moscow. Intelligence gathering on the Soviets was curbed on the grounds that you don’t spy on your allies.\nAmerica did the same. Moscow, needless to say, did not return the favour, leading Harvard intelligence expert Calder Walton to conclude that it “achieved its greatest wartime intelligence successes not against its enemies, the Axis powers, but instead its Western allies”.\nThe result was a dangerous, decades-long tension.\nThe Cold War continues – for Putin, trained in the art of interrogation in Communist East Berlin, it never went away. Britain and the West probably need to accept that fact, in order to have a realistic relationship with Russia – something that ultimately will be to everyone’s advantage.\nAll rights reserved. © 2021 Associated Newspapers Limited.",

  "Russia will never abandon Donetsk, Lugansk — Zakharova -  Russian Politics & Diplomacy - TASS",
  "Russia will never abandon Donetsk, Lugansk — Zakharova\n\n\nSOLNECHNOGORSK /Moscow Region/, August 3. /TASS/. Russia will never abandon the people of the Donetsk and Lugansk people's republics and it will continue to provide support for this region, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said at a meeting with participants in Russia's national education youth forum Terra Scientia.\n\"I can merely repeat what our country's leadership said: Russia will never abandon either Donetsk, or Lugansk. In the first place, this concerns the people who will be supported. This support has not stopped for a minute, let me stress once again, not for a minute, over years,\" Zakharova said. \"I am saying so not because I am someone who is somehow involved in foreign policy matters and international relations, but as a citizen of our country, who sees from inside what is being done to ensure the people we call compatriots, the people who have become or are becoming Russian citizens know that there is someone to stand for their lives, not only for their rights, but in the first place, their lives.\" \nShe stressed that speculations to the effect Russia had not done enough to provide assistance to the people of that region were at least unfair and did not reflect the real state of affairs. I can tell you as a person who is somehow concerned with this issue: a great deal has been done politically, economically, financially and in pure humanitarian terms,\" Zakharova said.\nShe stated that Russia would by no means take a break and would continue to exert the maximum efforts to provide more assistance to Donetsk and Lugansk.\n\"We have heard so many threats from our Western partners, so many sanctions have been taken and there has been so much aggression and blackmail against us over these years. Have we inched back at least once? Have we said at least once 'We are sorry it happened this way?' No. Have we ever revised our fundamental principles despite the colossal international pressure? Never,\" Zakharova stated.",
  "Russian police raid home of investigative journalist",
  "Russian police raid home of investigative journalist\nMOSCOW (AP) — Police in Russia raided the home of the chief editor of an investigative news site that was recently designated as a “foreign agent,” the latest move by authorities to raise the pressure on independent media before the country’s September parliamentary election. \nThe Insider news site chief editor Roman Dobrokhotov tweeted Wednesday that “police are knocking” on his apartment door, and his wife reported the raid to the OVD-Info legal aid group before her phone became unavailable. \nA lawyer from another legal aid group, Pravozashchita Otkrytki, headed to Dobrokhotov’s apartment. The group said police seized cellphones, laptops and tablets during the raid, as well as Dobrokhotov’s international passport. Sergei Yezhov, a journalist with The Insider, said Dobrokhotov was supposed to travel outside of Russia on Wednesday. \nPolice also raided the home of Dobrokhotov’s parents, The Insider said. After the searches, Dobrokhotov was taken to a police precinct for questioning and then released. \nHe told reporters outside the precinct that The Insider will continue to operate despite the pressure from authorities.\n“It will become more difficult to work now. I don’t have cell phones, I can’t travel and meet my colleagues — many of our investigations are international,” Dobrokhotov said. “And, of course, it’s serious pressure. But it’s clear that The Insider will continue to exist. Investigations will be released even if I am arrested. If they hope to halt the work of the news site, they hope in vain.”\nRussian opposition supporters, independent journalists and human rights activists have faced increased government pressure ahead of the Sept. 19 vote, which is widely seen as an important part of President Vladimir Putin’s efforts to cement his rule before the 2024 presidential election. \nThe 68-year-old Russian leader, who has been in power for more than two decades, pushed through constitutional changes last year that would potentially allow him to hold onto power until 2036.\nIn recent months, the government has designated several independent media outlets and journalists as “foreign agents” — a label that implies additional government scrutiny and carries strong pejorative connotations that could discredit the recipients. \nThe targeted outlets include VTimes and Meduza. VTimes subsequently shut down, citing the loss of advertisers, and Meduza launched a crowd-funding campaign after encountering the same problem. \nThe Insider was the latest addition to the list. The news outlet, which is registered in Latvia, has worked with the investigative group Bellingcat to investigate high-profile cases, such as the nerve agent poisonings of former Russian spy Sergei Sripal and Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny.\nThe Russian Justice Ministry acted under a law that is used to designate as foreign agents non-governmental organizations, media outlets and individuals who receive foreign funding and engage in activities loosely described as political.\nAnother law is used to outlaw groups deemed “undesirable” and makes membership in them a criminal offense. It has been used to ban 41 groups, including opposition groups, foreign NGOs and most recently, the publisher of Proekt, an online investigative media outlet.\nThe Justice Ministry last week also designated two Proekt journalists and three other reporters as foreign agents.\nRussia used the law to levy heavy fines on U.S.-funded broadcaster Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty for failing to identify its material as produced by foreign agents. The broadcaster has asked the European Court of Human Rights to intervene.\nAccording to The Insider, the searches targeting Dobrokhotov may be related to a slander case launched in April following a complaint by a Dutch blogger. The Insider accused Max van der Werff of working with Russian intelligence and military services to spread false information challenging the findings of the official investigation into the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 over eastern Ukraine, which killed all 298 people on board.\nThe legal aid group said Dobrokhotov was a witness in a criminal case against “unidentified persons” on the charges of slander, launched over a tweet in Dobrokhotov’s account that contains “disinformation about the downed Boeing MH-17.”\nEarlier this week, Russian authorities blocked about 50 websites linked to the imprisoned opposition leader Navalny. The move comes just a month after a court in Moscow outlawed Navalny’s political infrastructure — his Foundation for Fighting Corruption and a network of regional offices — as extremist in a ruling that prevents people associated with the groups from seeking public office and exposes them to lengthy prison terms. \nNavalny, Putin’s fiercest political foe, was arrested in January upon returning from Germany, where he spent five months recovering from a nerve agent poisoning that he blames on the Kremlin — an accusation rejected by Russian officials. \nIn February, the politician was ordered to serve 2½ years in prison for violating a suspended sentence from a 2014 embezzlement conviction that he dismissed as politically motivated.\nHis arrest and jailing sparked a wave of mass protests across Russia in what appeared to be a major challenge to the Kremlin. The authorities responded with mass arrests of demonstrators and criminal probes against Navalny’s closest associates. \nOn Wednesday, Lyubov Sobol, a top ally of Navalny and one of the few in his team who hasn’t left Russia despite being prosecuted on a number of charges, said Russia’s state communications watchdog Roskomnadzor demanded that Twitter take down her account. \n“What is it, if not the Kremlin’s hysteria ahead of the election?” Sobol wrote. \nIt wasn’t immediately clear whether Twitter would comply with the request.

  "Russia's mysterious campaign against Jehovah's Witnesses - ABC News",
  "Russia's mysterious campaign against Jehovah's Witnesses\nHundreds have been detained in a campaign no one is able to explain.\nRussia’s campaign against the Jehovah’s Witnesses \nMOSCOW -- In a bright, spotless apartment in a Moscow suburb, a small circle of people sat around a table in December 2019. Bowls of candies and teapots were set out, along with salads.\nThe group opened the meeting with a prayer and a hymn -- most of them shy and just murmuring along, raising their voices a little above some background music played on a television showing a preacher in a suit.\nThe people present were Jehovah's Witnesses -- a Christian religious sect first founded in the United States in the 19th century but now has an estimated 8 million followers around the world.\nIn many countries, such meetings would be nothing unusual. But in Russia, authorities now treat them as illegal, designating them as gatherings of \"extremists.\"\nThat means attendees meet in secret. Before arriving, they check the street for police. As they meet, they know there is a risk of officers knocking at the door or even breaking it down. If they are arrested, they could face years in prison.\nThese are the fears Jehovah's Witnesses have lived with in Russia since the group was outlawed in the country in 2017. The Russian supreme court that year banned the religion as \"extremist,\" and in doing so unleashed what is perhaps one of the worst but most mysterious persecution campaigns in Russia.\nThe estimated 175,000 adherents in Russia are now equated with members of dangerous terrorist organizations. The community has been subjected to hundreds of raids and arrests by Russian security forces and, in some places, alleged torture. Across Russia, hundreds have been charged as \"extremists,\" and dozens have been jailed in a campaign that human rights groups have struggled to explain.\nBanned under the Soviet Union and authorized in the liberal years following its collapse, the renewed persecution of Jehovah's Witnesses is seen by some as the frightening return of Soviet oppression once thought gone as well as a reflection of how security services under President Vladimir Putin are turning the clock back on dissent.\n\"We are talking about a group of people who are practicing their religion peacefully, who are not carrying out any violent actions, who are not interfering with public order,\" said Tanya Lokshina, the Human Rights Watch associate director for Europe and Central Asia.\n\"And those people are treated as dangerous criminals. As, quote unquote, 'extremists.'\"\n'Reminds me of the Inquisition'\nThe Jehovah's Witnesses were banned under an anti-extremism law, nominally intended for dangerous, violent organizations. It means that the peaceful group, which has no history of violence and forbids involvement in politics, was placed alongside terrorist organizations such as ISIS or the Japanese Doomsday cult Aum Shinrikyo, which carried a nerve agent attack on the Tokyo subway in 1995.\nPeople charged with participating in the Jehovah's Witnesses can be sentenced up to six years in a prison camp, and organizers can face up to 10 years. In many cases, just praying in a group has been enough for police to bring charges against a person.\nSince 2017, police have carried out hundreds of raids on Jehovah's Witnesses' homes and meeting places all across Russia, according to the religious group as well as human rights groups. Over 500 adherents have been charged under the extremism law, and dozens are already jailed on sentences up to eight years.\nDozens of those charged are elderly -- some as old as 89. In the far eastern city of Vladivostok, an 86 year-old was charged with extremism and placed on a terrorism watchlist.\n\"It reminds me of the Inquisition,\" said Evgeny Kandaurov, a journalist and Jehovah's Witness whose home was raided earlier this year.\nThe \"extremist\" designation also means that when police conduct raids on Jehovah's Witnesses, they act as though they are storming hideouts of armed terrorists.\nDozens of videos released by law enforcement show officers in full body armor and helmets, often armed with guns and batons, entering the apartments of terrified people. In some cases, police rip down doors with power saws and crow bars.\nThe show of force is directed against people usually sitting quietly in prayer or otherwise defenseless, asleep in their pajamas. Officers often appear aware there's no threat, sometimes just ringing the door bell and waiting while standing in their combat gear.\nOfficers act \"as if some very dangerous criminal activity were actually going on,\" Lokshina said. \"While in fact what they're dealing with is people who are praying and talking and peacefully practicing their faith.\"\n 'I thought I was going to suffocate to death'\nIn its first years, the enforcement campaign mostly took place in regions far outside Moscow.\nOne morning in February 2019, in the northern city of Surgut, about 1,800 miles from Moscow, law enforcement officers rounded up around 40 Jehovah's Witnesses, according to the church.\nThe believers were brought for interrogation at the local branch of Russia's Investigative Committee, which handles serious crimes. There, at least seven detained men said officers tortured them, including with electric shocks, beatings and suffocation.\n\"They tied my hands and legs with tape,\" one of the men, Sergey Volosnikov, 42, told ABC News in an interview last year.\n\"They put a bag over my head and put me on the floor. Then they started to close the bag so that air couldn't get in. I was already preparing myself that I'm going to … .to suffocate to death,\" he said.\nVolosnikov said police then tortured him with a stun gun before demanding he sign a confession.\nThe other men described similar torture, telling ABC News they were taken into the room one by one after refusing to confess to extremism charges. Some of the men said the officers threatened to rape them, pulling down their underwear and using a stun gun on their buttocks. Others said police injected them with a liquid and told them it would cause their hearts to stop.\n\"I was lying on the floor, all tied up with the sack on my head. And they started to discuss some kind of object, right, which they would rape me with,\" said Artyom Kim, who said he was taken into the room three times, where he was also electrocuted and suffocated.\n\"I was afraid for my life. I was already saying goodbye to all my relatives,\" he said.\nThe seven men have demanded Russian federal law enforcement investigate their allegations of torture, but their requests have been repeatedly rejected, they said.\n\"You can't take faith from someone. If he believes, it means he believes,\" Volosnikov said. \"To beat the faith out of someone, that's already totalitarianism.\"\nThe Kremlin has largely refused to comment on the campaign against the Jehovah's Witnesses. When previously asked by reporters about it, spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said the group is banned and that there is nothing more to discuss.\nIn Surgut, nearly two dozen Jehovah's Witnesses remain under criminal investigation and will likely face a trial on the extremism charges.\nTimofey Zhukov, a local lawyer in Surgut and a Jehovah's Witness, has helped coordinate the defense of those charged. But police have put him under investigation as well.\nIn February 2020, ABC News attended a court hearing that Zhukov and around 20 Jehovah's Witnesses were at to support another believer facing charges.\nBefore it started, two plainclothes police officers entered and approached Zhukov, informing him they were there to take him to a psychiatric hospital located nearly 800 miles away.\nA court had earlier ordered Zhukov to undergo psychological evaluation at the hospital, something he said he believed was intended to pressure him for fighting the criminal charges.\nHe refused to go with the two officers on the basis that the court order was under appeal. After a tense standoff, the two officers backed down and left.\n\"It's one of their methods of repression,\" Zhukov said. \"If there hadn't been cameras and so many people here, the conversation would have ended differently.\"\nBut as Zhukov exited the court building later, the officers jumped him, trying to drag him away from the crowd of other Jehovah's Witnesses.\nZhukov managed to escape, but a day later was grabbed again by police. He said he spent three weeks in a psychiatric hospital, housed with other men in a room with barred windows. His detention echoes a practice from Soviet times when authorities incarcerated dissidents in mental institutions.\n\"All this is happening just because I read the Bible and am a person of faith,\" Zhukov said.\n'Nobody knows why'\nBesides its extravagant displays of force and harsh sentences, the campaign has another unusual feature: No one really knows why it is happening.\n\"Nobody knows,\" Lokshina said. \"A lot of people have been trying to figure it out, but nobody really knows.\"\nUnlike efforts to outlaw political opponents of the Kremlin, there is no obvious motive for why Russian authorities have targeted Jehovah's Witnesses.\nInternationally, the group is best known for their proselytising on door steps. They share similar beliefs with many mainstream Christian churches, though they have a number of unique values as well. Some of the beliefs -- such as rejecting blood transfusions -- are controversial, but none are violent.\nJehovah's Witnesses are also forbidden from getting involved in politics, making the campaign even more puzzling.\nIn the early days of the campaign, some observers believed the campaign might have been launched without the Kremlin's direct involvement.\nWhen Putin was asked about the ban in 2018, he appeared surprised, saying it was \"total nonsense\" and adding it \"should be looked into carefully.\"\nSuch words from Putin are usually interpreted as a signal to pull back. But since his remarks, the campaign against the Jehovah's Witnesses has intensified. In the past year, it has spread to Moscow, which had previously been largely spared arrests and raids.\nAs the campaign becomes broader, some experts have concluded it must be directed from the top of government and at least approved by Putin.\n\"I think the decisions must be made at the top level,\" said Alexander Verkhovsky, director of the SOVA Center, which studies extremism in Russia.\n'Extremely suspicious'\nWhile it's unclear why the group is being targeted, some experts see the church's links to the United States, as well as its size and active search for converts, as likely reasons.\nThe Jehovah's Witnesses' distinctive belief of refusing to interact with governments is also likely key, Verkhovsky said. Although they are permitted to obey laws and pay taxes, believers are prohibited from joining the military or holding any government posts.\n\"For our authorities, that looks extremely suspicious,\" Verkhovsky said.\nJehovah's Witnesses have frequently become victims of authoritarian regimes. They were persecuted under the Nazis and in the Soviet Union, where they were banned until its collapse in 1991. Under Joseph Stalin, tens of thousands of Jehovah's Witnesses were deported en masse to Siberia in 1951.\nRussia's campaign against the Jehovah's Witnesses has occurred as the country has become far more authoritarian under Putin. The same anti-extremism law used against Jehovah's Witnesses was applied this year to outlaw the movement of the Kremlin's main political opponent, Alexey Navalny, who remains in a prison camp.\nSenior Russian officials have stoked an atmosphere of anti-Western paranoia, urging the security services to be alert for foreign groups seeking to undermine Russia. The broader turn back toward Soviet-style suspicion of dissent appears to have also brought the government's former attitude to the Jehovah's Witnesses along with it.\n\"My impression is that the anti-extremism law is used when somebody -- I don't know who, but somebody -- sees a religious movement as a political threat. How they see this threat, we do not know, because they do not talk about it in public,\" Verkhovsky said.\nIn such an atmosphere, local security forces can also see extremism cases against Jehovah's Witnesses as easy ways to earn approval and promotion, he said.\nThe United States has been increasingly vocal in condemning the campaign. In December, the State Department added Russia to its special watchlist for \"severe violators\" of religious freedom, which also includes Iran and Pakistan. The U.S. in 2019 also announced entry bans on two senior Russian law enforcement officers in Surgut over the alleged torture of the Jehovah's Witnesses there.\nBut there is no indication the campaign is slowing down. In February, police and Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB) launched raids across Moscow, saying it searched 16 addresses and made arrests.\nAmong those swept up was Yury Temirbulatov, a teacher and Jehovah's Witness who had spoken to ABC News in the beginning of 2020.\nAt the time, he and others had been concerned the campaign might reach Moscow but said they felt relatively safe.\nHe said back then that he did not understand why they were being persecuted. He is now in a Moscow detention center and faces up to six years in prison if convicted.\n\"For the past 20 years, I teach people only to love, to be very polite, to be pay taxes, to work hard,\" he said. \"I don't understand.\"\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",

  "EXPLAINER: What's fueling Russia's 'unprecedented' fires?",
  "EXPLAINER: What’s fueling Russia’s ‘unprecedented’ fires?\nMOSCOW (AP) — Thousands of wildfires engulf broad expanses of Russia each year, destroying forests and shrouding regions in acrid smoke.\nNortheastern Siberia has had particularly massive fires this summer amid record-setting heat. Many other regions across the vast country also have battled wildfires.\nSome factors behind Russia’s endemic wildfires and their consequences:\nRECORD HEAT\nIn recent years, Russia has recorded high temperatures that many scientists regard as a clear result of climate change. The hot weather has caused permafrost to melt and fueled a growing number of fires.\nThe vast Sakha-Yakutia region of Siberia has had a long spell of extremely hot and dry weather this summer, with temperatures reaching 39 degrees Celsius (102 degrees Fahrenheit) and setting records for several days. The heat wave helped spark hundreds of fires, which so far have scorched more than 1.5 million hectares (3.7 million acres) of land, making it the worst-affected region in Russia. \nThe fires have shrouded Yakutia’s cities, towns and villages in thick smoke, forcing authorities to briefly suspend flights at the regional capital’s airport. The Defense Ministry deployed transport planes and helicopters to help douse the flames. \nFedot Tumusov, a member of the Russian parliament who represents the region, called the blazes “unprecedented” in their scope.\nMONITORING DIFFICULTIES\nThe forests that cover huge areas of Russia make monitoring and quickly spotting new fires a daunting task.\nIn 2007, a federal network to spot fires from aircraft was disbanded and had its assets turned over to regional authorities. The much-criticized change resulted in the program’s rapid deterioration.\nThe government later reversed the move and reestablished the federal agency in charge of monitoring forests from the air. However, its resources remain limited, making it hard to survey the massive forests of Siberia and the Far East.\nNEGLECT OF FIRE SAFETY RULES\nWhile some wildfires are sparked by lightning, experts estimate that over 70% of them are caused by people, from carelessly discarding cigarettes to abandoned campfires, but there are other causes.\nAuthorities regularly conduct controlled burns, setting a fire to clear the way for new vegetation or to deprive unplanned wildfires of fuel. Observers say such intentional burns often are poorly managed and sometimes trigger bigger blazes instead of containing them.\nFarmers also use the same technique to burn grass and small trees on agricultural lands. Such burns regularly get out of control.\nARSON\nActivists and experts say that fires are often set deliberately to cover up evidence of illegal lumbering or to create new places for timber harvesting under the false pretext of clearing burned areas.\nActivists in Siberia and the Far East allege such arson is driven by strong demand for timber in the colossal Chinese market, and they have called for a total ban on timber exports to China.\nOfficials have acknowledged the problem and pledged to tighten oversight, but Russia’s far-flung territory and regulatory loopholes make it hard to halt the illegal activity.\nCritics blame the 2007 forest code that gave control over timberlands to regional authorities and businesses, eroding centralized monitoring, fueling corruption and contributing to illegal tree-cutting practices that help spawn fires.\n CONTROVERSIAL REGULATIONS\nRussian law allows authorities to let wildfires burn in certain areas if the potential damage is considered not worth the costs of containing them. \nCritics have long assailed the provision, arguing it encourages inaction by authorities and slows firefighting efforts so a blaze that could have been extinguished at a relatively small cost is often allowed to burn uncontrolled.\n“They eventually have to extinguish it anyway, but the damage and the costs are incomparable,” said Mikhail Kreindlin of Greenpeace Russia.\nLONG-TERM CONSEQUENCES\nIn addition to destroying trees, wildfires also kill wildlife and pose a threat to human health by polluting the air.\nCarbon emissions from fires and the destruction of forests, which are a major source of oxygen, also contribute to global warming and its potentially catastrophic impact.\nThis year’s fires in Siberia already have emitted more carbon than those in some previous years, according to Mark Parrington, a senior scientist at the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts.\nHe said the peat fires that are common in Siberia and many other Russian regions are particularly harmful in terms of emissions because peat has been absorbing carbon for tens of thousands of years. \n“Then it’s releasing all that carbon back into the atmosphere,” Parrington said. \nWhile pledging adherence to the Paris agreement on climate change, Russian officials often underline the key role played by their forests in slowing down global warming. However, regular wildfires have the opposite effect, dramatically boosting carbon emissions.\n“They emphasize that huge areas are covered by forests but neglect the effect of greenhouse gas emissions resulting from fires,” Greenpeace’s Kreindlin said.",
  "Russia blocks access to websites of Alexei Navalny and close allies | Russia | The Guardian",
  "Russia blocks access to websites of Alexei Navalny and close allies\nAction comes as Kremlin increases pressure on opponents and critics ahead of parliamentary elections\nLast modified on Mon 26 Jul 2021 19.29 BST\nRussian authorities have restricted access to Alexei Navalny’s website and those of dozens of his close allies, the imprisoned opposition leader’s team has said.\nThe action came as the government increased pressure on opposition supporters, independent journalists and human rights activists ahead of the country’s parliamentary election. The September vote is widely seen as an important part of Vladimir Putin’s efforts to cement his rule before a 2024 presidential election.\n\nPutin, who has been in power for more than two decades, pushed through constitutional changes last year that would potentially allow him to hold on to power until 2036.\nNavalny’s website and those of his top strategist, Leonid Volkov, and his longtime ally Lyubov Sobol were unavailable on Monday. The sites of Navalny’s Anti-Corruption Foundation and a network of about 40 regional offices could not be accessed nor could the site of the Alliance of Doctors union, which Navalny backs, and an online page calling for his freedom.\nAccording to Russia’s state communications watchdog, Roskomnadzor, access to all of the websites was restricted at the behest of the Russian prosecutor general’s office. In a statement to the Interfax news agency, Roskomnadzor confirmed blocking the sites because they were being “used for propaganda” of extremist groups.\nThey “have decided to completely wipe us off the internet”, Maria Pevchikh, a Navalny associate, tweeted.\nPutin’s most ardent political foe was arrested in January when he returned from Germany, where he had spent five months recovering from nerve agent poisoning that he blames on the Kremlin, an accusation Russian officials reject.\nHe was ordered to serve two and a half years in prison in February for violating the terms of a suspended sentence from a 2014 embezzlement conviction that he dismissed as politically motivated.\nHis arrest and imprisonment prompted a wave of protests across Russia’s 11 time zones in what appeared to be a major challenge to the Kremlin. The authorities responded with mass arrests of demonstrators and the criminal prosecution of Navalny’s closest associates.\nThe government has also outlawed the Anti-Corruption Foundation, which Navalny founded 10 years ago and has published dozens of widely watched videos exposing the alleged corruption of senior officials, as an extremist group, along with the network of regional offices he had relied on to organise protests.\nThe ruling not only barred the foundation and the offices from operating, but also prevents people associated with them from seeking public office and exposes them to lengthy prison terms.\nNavalny’s team pointed out on Monday that the Smart Voting website, a project to support candidates most likely to defeat those from the Kremlin’s dominant United Russia party in various elections, remained available.\nVolkov suggested the authorities might block the strategy site closer to the September election, in which Navalny’s team plans to deploy the Smart Voting project.\nIvan Zhdanov, a close Navalny ally, said in an Instagram post that the team was not surprised the websites had been blocked and had been ready for such a move. He urged supporters to follow Navalny’s team and its members on social media, “where it’s harder to block us”, and to download a mobile app that contains all the recent investigations and the Smart Voting project.\n“An app cannot currently be blocked,” he wrote.

  "Information Warfare Looms Larger in Russia’s New Security Strategy - Defense One",
  "\n                    People watch a broadcast of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s 2018 question-and-answer session on a laptop in a car.\n                  \n                    SERGEI MALGAVKO\\TASS VIA GETTY IMAGES\n                  \n\n\n        Information Warfare Looms Larger in Russia’s New Security Strategy\n      \n\nPatrick Tucker\n\nThe Russian government sees itself as increasingly vulnerable to foreign and domestic subversion, according to a July 3 update to the Kremlin’s 2015 national security strategy, and is moving to shield Russian citizens from outside voices and improve its influence-warfare capabilities. \n“A notable change from 2015 is the greatly expanded definition of subversion, including a long list of behavior by non-state actors that are said to be undermining Russian values and the stability of the state,” Dartmouth professor William Wohlforth said in an interview. \nThese include also humanitarian organizations like Human Rights Watch and Western tech companies like Twitter and Facebook. \nThe new document expresses concern over Western governments’ manipulation of Russian affairs. “The declaration of a ‘safe information space’ as a core national interest underscores the importance of information war to the Russian government,”  said Ivana Stradner, a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute specializing in law, Eastern Europe and hybrid warfare. “This is a continuation of the Russian government’s pathological self-victimhood. These claims, like Russia’s threats to ban Twitter this past spring, are aimed at bolstering Russian claims of ‘digital sovereignty’ through which President Vladimir Putin believes he can stave off the types of ‘color revolutions’ that have toppled other dictators in post-Soviet nations.”\nThat’s not necessarily new, even if it is new to this document, said Samuel Bendett, a CNA adviser who is an adjunct senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security.\n“Russia sees itself as a target of persistent and ongoing information operations by the West against Russian Federation targets like the military and security organizations, along with critical infrastructure. This new national security strategy officially elevates these information and cyber threats to the level of an existential challenge to Russia’s long-term survival,” Bendett said.\nThe strategy isn’t just bad news for non-governmental organizations. It also pushes for Russia to engage other countries to partner with Russia on “cybersecurity” issues according to Russia’s definition of cyber security. \n“This is significant because Russia has already been using UN subcommittees to frustrate U.S. efforts to develop a cybercrime treaty,” Stradner said. “Russia even managed to beat out the U.S. for the UN’s approval to draft a global cybercrime treaty.” She called it “part of Russia’s broader revanchist strategy to use international organizations to regain its Soviet-era prestige and power.”\nRussia scholar Mark Galeotti described the strategy as “paranoid,” particularly in the way it describes Russian “traditional values” as under constant threat from the West. \nRelated articles\nRussia’s Latest Hack Shows How Useful ‘Criminal Groups’ Are to the Kremlin\nBiden Urges Putin to Give up Russian Ransomware Gangsters, Threatens Unspecified 'Consequences'\nWhat Really Happened in the Black Sea? A Victory for Russian Disinformation\nPutin Suddenly Looks Very Small \n“Let’s put aside just what ‘traditional Russian values’ may be—would they include serfdom, the knout and the terem (the social exclusion of women)?” Galeotti wrote in the Moscow Times. “Let’s put aside the slight of pen that manages to lump the State Department, al Qaeda, Human Rights Watch, and Facebook in the same array of hostile forces. This in effect reclassifies the modern world and all the social and economic revolutions that are reshaping it as a threat.”\nThe strategy document suggests a growing role for Russian intelligence services like the FSB and the SVR in addition to the information arms of the GRU, all entities that have carried out advanced information warfare operations against Western targets. In essence the document serves as a mandate to expand their activities (Russia has denied evidence-based allegations about its role in cyber operations.)\n“We can expect this [new strategy] to manifest in the foreign development of intelligence missions similar to the Internet Research Agency, which has been linked to multiple meddling operations across the West,” Stradner said. \nThe strategy release was delayed, likely due to the U.S. presidential election, since the outcome of the election would directly affect Russian strategy, according to a brief by intel firm Intelligence Online. The Biden administration has been pressing the Kremlin to curb Russian ransomware hackers who have struck Western targets from within Russian borders or nearby friendly states. \n“You could say some of the sections [of the strategy] are setting up a rhetorical trap for Moscow,” Wohlforth said. “After all, if all these actions by multinational corporations, NGOs and the like are seen as subversive threats to Russia, what are we to say about ransomware hackers operating on Russian territory?”\n\n\n\nNEXT STORY:\n\n              Impersonations of Military Members on Social Media On the Rise, New Report Says\n            \n\n\n\n\nDo Not Sell My Personal Information\nWhen you visit our website, we store cookies on your browser to collect\n          information.

  "Calls to deploy US air defense prove Kiev’s provocative policy towards Russia — diplomat -  World - TASS",
  "Calls to deploy US air defense prove Kiev’s provocative policy towards Russia — diplomat\n\n\nMOSCOW, August 11. /TASS/. Ukraine’s call to station the US air defense forces on its territory proves the provocative nature of Kiev’s policy in the region and with regards to Russia, Russian Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova told Channel One on Wednesday.\n\"This, it seems to me, is proof <...> of Ukraine’s provocative policy both in the region and with regards to Russia. This is the proof of the US’ intentions regarding building relations with Ukraine itself when the Russian factor is at the center of these relations,\" she said.\nAccording to the diplomat, such statements are in the interests of the collective West since they lead to the destabilization of the situation in Ukraine. She continued, \"an attempt to endlessly play the Ukrainian card in the context\" of Russia has become the essence of Western policy in the region.\nThe spokeswoman added that the provocative policy of Ukrainian authorities above all hurts its own citizens. \"The Ukrainian people don’t need this. This contradicts the ingrained opinions of the Ukrainian citizens, regardless of their political inclinations, since they need stability.\"\nAt the same time, the diplomat expressed confidence that this was \"not the last provocative statement\" on the part of the current Ukrainian government.\nUkrainian Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Reintegration of Uncontrolled Territories Alexei Reznikov during a meeting with the head of the Jamestown Foundation Glen Howard within the framework of a working visit to the US stated the necessity to \"expand the package in the security sphere for Ukraine […] above all, by deploying the air defense forces, even by stationing US subdivisions.\" According to the Ukrainian official, Kiev is concerned by the alleged intentions of the Russian Federation to deploy nuclear weapons to Crimea.",
  "Russia rights group linked to Navalny closes amid prosecution fears | Russia | The Guardian",
  "Russia rights group linked to Navalny closes amid prosecution fears\nTeam 29 is the latest victim of Kremlin crackdown on organisations it considers ‘undesirable’\nLast modified on Mon 19 Jul 2021 01.49 BST\nA rights group in Russia has announced it is shutting down, citing fears its members and supporters may be prosecuted after authorities blocked its website for allegedly publishing content from an “undesirable” organisation.\nTeam 29 – an association of lawyers and journalists specialising in treason and espionage cases and freedom of information issues – said on Sunday that Russian authorities accused it of spreading content from a Czech non-governmental organisation that had been declared “undesirable” in Russia.\n\nThe group’s website was blocked on Friday, even though it rejected the accusations, and its lawyers said they believed the government’s next step could be to prosecute members and supporters.\n“In these conditions, continuation of Team 29’s activities creates direct and clear threat to the safety of a large number of people, and we can’t ignore that risk,” the group said, adding that it would take down all its online content in order to avoid any risks and that its lawyers would continue representing their clients in a personal capacity.\nThe closure of Team 29 comes as pressure mounts on opposition supporters, independent journalists and human rights activists in Russia ahead of September’s parliamentary elections. The vote is widely seen as an important part of President Vladimir Putin’s efforts to cement his rule ahead of the 2024 presidential election. The 68-year-old leader, who has been in power for more than two decades, pushed through constitutional changes last year that would potentially allow him to hold on to power until 2036.\nIn recent months, Russian authorities have increased the pressure on independent news media, designating two popular independent outlets, Meduza and VTimes, as “foreign agents” and outlawing the publisher of the Proekt investigative media outlet, while also listing its journalists as “foreign agents”. VTimes shut down shortly after that.\nLast month, a Moscow court outlawed organisations founded by imprisoned Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny by labelling them extremist. The ruling barred people associated with Navalny’s Foundation for Fighting Corruption and his sprawling regional network from seeking public office. Many of Navalny’s allies had planned to run for parliamentary seats in Russia’s September elections.\nTeam 29, including its prominent lawyer Ivan Pavlov, was involved in defending Navalny’s foundation in court. In April, Russian authorities launched a criminal case against Pavlov, who is also representing a former journalist accused of treason in a high-profile case, accusing him of disclosing information related to a police investigation.",
  "Russia May Be 'Baiting Us Into Shooting': Top US Admiral in Europe",
  "A leading-edge research firm focused on digital transformation.\n\n                Good\n                \n\n\nSubscriber\nAccount active\n                since\n                \n\nRussia's risky flybys may be attempts at 'baiting us into shooting first,' top US admiral says\nAggressive Russian maneuvers around US and NATO forces in the Black Sea in recent weeks appear meant to provoke a response, the top US Navy admiral in Europe said on July 21.\nNATO militaries conducted exercises in the Black Sea from mid-June to mid-July, the largest of which, Sea Breeze, involved 32 ships and 40 aircraft from 32 countries.\nIn the days before Sea Breeze began on June 28, Russian aircraft conducted what Western officials called unsafe flights around NATO warships in the Black Sea. Russian and NATO forces continued to operate near each other in the Black Sea and Mediterranean Sea over the following weeks.\nThe latest encounters came amid heightened military activity in the region, but such interactions are not uncommon in the Black Sea, which has remained tense since Russia's 2014 seizure of Crimea.\n\"NATO allies and partners operating in that area by themselves are constantly shadowed by Russian vessels, and by and large, those interactions are safe and professional, although they're meant to intimidate,\" Adm. Robert Burke, commander of US Navy Forces in Europe and Africa, said at a US Navy Memorial event.\n\"When a strike aircraft overflies a destroyer at 100 feet altitude and right over top, our [commanding officers] are making a judgment call whether that strike fighter is on an attack profile or not,\" Burke added. \"It could be argued that they're baiting us into shooting first. We're not going to do that first without provocation, but I'm also not going to ask my commanding officers to take the first shot on the chin.\"\nRussian and NATO forces frequently operate in close proximity. Russia regularly reports intercepts of NATO aircraft flying near Russian borders. NATO militaries often intercept Russian aircraft flying near their borders.\nUS officials have on multiple occasions criticized Russia for what they call \"unsafe and unprofessional\" intercepts of US aircraft and warships in the seas around Europe. Those include low-altitude flights over US warships, which are especially risky because of uncertainty about intent and the potential for accidents.\nIn the past, Russian aircraft would fly without weapons in a configuration called \"wings clean,\" Burke's predecessor, now-retired Adm. James Foggo, said in 2019.\n\"In the interactions and the intercepts I see today, they're coming out 'wings dirty,' or they have weapons on board,\" Foggo said at the time. \"That's another bit of the calculus that goes in the commanding officer's mind on ... what is the intent of that pilot.\"\nIn his remarks this month, Burke said those close encounters have \"tactical risk\" that \"could turn into a strategic issue.\"\n\"That's a big concern with this increasing aggressiveness. So we'll have to watch that very closely,\" Burke added.\nRussian and NATO forces have continued to train in the Black Sea since Sea Breeze ended on July 10. NATO navies worked on interoperability and readiness, while Russian aircraft and coastal-defense units practiced attacking enemy forces.\nBurke said this month that the seizure of Crimea was an \"extreme\" form of \"constant bullying\" by Russia that is meant to influence other countries and the Russian public.\nThat Russian action, including military buildups and restricting access to international waters, ultimately \"results in some nations avoiding going to those areas, which is exactly the behavior change that the Russians are seeking,\" Burke said.\nRussia is \"not 10 feet tall\" and its leaders \"understand and respect\" NATO capabilities, but it has \"heavily modernized\" its military, particularly its submarines, and learned from watching the US fight in Iraq and Afghanistan, Burke said.\n\"The Russian government is still very much an existential threat to the United States,\" Burke said. \"I think is as much of a threat today as the Soviet Union was in a Cold War.\"",

  "Vast wildfires in Russia's Yakutia set emissions record - monitor\nFire burns in a forest near the village of Magaras in the region of Yakutia, Russia July 17, 2021. Picture taken July 17, 2021. REUTERS/Roman Kutukov/File Photo\nMOSCOW, Aug 4 (Reuters) - Summer wildfires have already produced a record amount of carbon emissions in Russia's Siberian region of Yakutia, with still more weeks of the fire season to come, according to the European Union's Copernicus satellite monitoring unit.\nEnvironmentalists fear the fires, fuelled by hot weather, may thaw Siberian permafrost and peatlands, releasing even more carbon that was long stored in the frozen tundra.\nSo far, this year's fires have torn through more than 4.2 million hectares in Yakutia, sending enormous plumes of smoke as far as the North Pole this week thousands of kilometers away.\nThe climate-warming emissions since June total more than 505 megatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent, according to estimates by the EU's Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAM).\nThat is already well above last year's record total of 450 megatonnes for the entire fire season, said Mark Parrington, a senior scientist at CAM.\nYakutia in northeastern Siberia is Russia's largest region, known for its tundra and bitter winters. It would be the world's eighth largest country if it were independent.\n'CONTINENTAL SCALE'\nWhile wildfire is part of the natural forest cycle for Russia's northern boreal forests, scientists have been stunned by the scale and intensity of blazes in recent years.\nThat has coincided with extreme warming in the Arctic, where average temperatures are rising more than three times as fast as the rest of the world.\nTowns in Yakutia have sometimes been blanketed by acrid smoke so thick it blocks out the sun. Last month, Moscow sent military troops and planes to help the firefighting effort.\nThis week, smoke traveled more than 3,000 kilometres from Yakutia to the North Pole.\n\"What makes this particularly peculiar is that the air masses with smoke are reaching that far north.

  "Why Russia’s Olympic punishment backfired | The Spectator",
  "Why Russia’s Olympic punishment backfired\nThe Tokyo Olympics are over and fifth place in the medals table went to the ‘ROC’, the Russian Olympic Committee. Rather than being punished for its state-run doping programme, Russia has turned it into a perverse triumph, illustrating the weakness of sanctions as a way of trying to shape international behaviour.\nOf course, Moscow denied systematic cheating, but after the World Anti-Doping agency imposed a four-year ban in 2019, reduced to two years by the Court of Arbitration for Sport in 2020, they were forced to accept that if Russian athletes were going to compete, they could not do so under their own flag.\nThey hardly went deep undercover, though. At the 2018 PyeongChang winter Olympics, they wore plain grey uniforms and took the podium to the Olympic anthem. By contrast, while the 335 Russians in Tokyo couldn’t compete under the Russian flag, their symbol was the Olympic logo in its white, blue and red colours, and their white uniforms were emblazoned in blue and red. Instead of the Russian national anthem, they celebrated victories to Piano Concerto No. 1 by Tchaikovsky. \nAnd that anthem was often heard: Russia came fifth in the medals table and third in the total number of medals won. While the athletes were formally part of the ‘ROC’ team, in practice everyone called them the Russians. \nThis hardly counted as a particular blow to Moscow. Indeed, if anything it generated a certain belligerent defiance. The foreign ministry issued a video in which sharp-tongued spokesperson Maria Zakharova was shown boxing a mannequin marked ‘press’ before answering staged questions about the Russian presence in Tokyo in which she said\nthat ‘the status does not matter. The most important thing is the pride our sportsmen have, and the world knows this.’ Her video ended with the moderately witty hashtag #WeWillROCYou that became a leitmotif of the Russian response.\nNor was this just the government. The famous DJ Smash mixed Queen’s ‘We Will Rock You’ with Piano Concerto No. 1, and this became something of an unofficial theme for videos posted on TikTok showing Russian successes.\nOf course, the reason why Moscow is still annoyed about the ROC designation is because they do believe they have been singled out for special and hostile treatment. The official line is that the doping programme did not happen. The unofficial one is that everyone\ndopes, but only the Russians get punished. There may be some truth in that. Although institutionalised doping operations like Russia’s may be rare, the Economist\npulled together a range of surveys to suggest that ‘between 10 and 40 per cent of athletes in Tokyo might be cheating.’ Meanwhile, Russian athletes who may well have been entirely clean for their careers are mocked when they do badly, traduced when they do well. \nAfter he lost the gold to Evgeny Rylov in the 200 meter backstroke, for example, American swimmer Ryan Murphy claimed\nhe had been ‘swimming in a race that’s probably not clean.’ The American rower Megan Kalmoe was even less subtle, saying the Russians were ‘a crew who shouldn’t even be here’, adding that seeing then win silver was a ‘nasty feeling.’\nThis is the modern world of sanctions in a nutshell. Too often, measures are enough to annoy, not enough to influence.\nWhen dealing with a country as powerful as Russia, it is hard to conceive of anything which is truly going to be substantive enough to force the Kremlin to change tack. Economic sanctions have not forced Moscow to surrender Crimea or stop its undeclared aggression in the Donbas. Personal sanctions against alleged ‘Putin cronies’ certainly affect individuals, but do not make the Kremlin think twice. (If anything, Putin has been trying to get his allies to ‘de-offshorise’\nand get their money back to Russia – where it is within his reach.)\nThis doesn’t mean doing nothing. It just means acknowledging that when the West or the international community wants to punish rules-breakers, it needs to think about what may actually have a meaningful effect – rather than just make people feel righteous – and what the potential backlash may be. Time and again, though, we don’t. \nMark Galeotti is the author of We Need to Talk About Putin and A Short History of Russia",

  "See Russia’s new Checkmate fighter jet unveiled at defense expo",
  "See Russia’s new Checkmate fighter jet unveiled at defense expo\n Correction: A currency conversion from Russian roubles to U.S. dollars was miscalculated. That value is now updated in the story.\n ZHUKOVSKY, Russia — Russian aircraft manufacturer Sukhoi showed off its new Checkmate jet during the MAKS 2021 aviation show last week, presenting it as a fifth-generation fighter.\n The unveiling of the light, single-engine aircraft comes amid the country’s current work on the Su-57, a heavy fighter jet also developed by Sukhoi. The Su-57 had its first flight test in 2010, but crashed during another 2019 test. That same year, the Russian military bought 76 of the planes, with delivery expected to being by 2022.\n A spokesman for Rostec, which owns Sukhoi parent company United Aircraft Corporation, told Defense News that foreign countries have expressed interest in the Checkmate. Rostec CEO Sergey Chemezov said the firm is targeting Middle Eastern and African countries as potential customers.\n “The machine can perform a wide range of tasks and is not whimsical in maintenance,” the spokesman added. “Moreover, the aircraft has an open architecture and can be assembled in several configurations, configured in accordance with the desires of the customer.\n Local and foreign media described the Checkmate presented at the air show in Zhukovsky as reminiscent of the American-made F-35 jet. Chemezov told reporters that the new plane will cost between $25 million and $30 million. An F-35 costs about $90 million.\n The conservative online news outlet Vzglyad called the aircraft a “Su-57 for the poor,” adding that “perhaps it is a kind of constructor, an aircraft ‘Lego,’ a jet originally assembled from the already tested blocks. A sort of ‘leftover,’ inherited by the OAK [United Aircraft Corporation] from the gigantic funds allocated by the state for the creation of the Su-57.”\n Fear of missing out?\nSign up for the Early Bird Brief, the defense industry's most comprehensive news and information, straight to your inbox.\n Thanks for signing up. \nBy giving us your email, you are opting in to the Early Bird Brief.\n For his part, the head of the Centre for Analysis of Strategies and Technologies in Moscow, Ruslan Pukhov, wonders how long it will take for Sukhoi to deliver the new jet, telling Gazeta.Ru that the country needs it “today.”\n According to Rostec, the MAKS 2021 show “exceeded” expectations, with Russia’s weapons exports agency Rosoboroexport — which is managed by Rostec CEO Sergey Chemezov — signing 13 foreign contracts worth €1 billion (U.S. $1.2 billion). In total, Rostec’s various subsidiaries signed contracts worth 230 billion roubles (U.S. $3 billion) with foreign customers.\n The show took place July 20-25 and saw 831 companies from 56 countries in attendance. For its part, Rostec presented more than 500 civilian and military technologies, including drones and engines. But while the event fulfilled its commercial purpose, it was not without a political message.\n The daily Nezavisimaya Gazeta pointed out that visitors at the Checkmate stand were able to see imagery of the British warship HMS Defender, which Russia reportedly fired upon in June while it transited the Black Sea. While Russia said it was trying to force the vessel what it claims are its territorial waters around Crimea, Britain denies this account of events.\nAlexander Bratersky is the Russia correspondent at Defense News. He has covered U.S.-Russian relations, NATO and Middle Eastern affairs, and Russian policy in Syria. He previously worked at the Moscow Times and Izvestia as a political reporter, as well as RIA Novosti as a Washington correspondent. He also dabbles in stand-up comedy.",

In April, the FBI urged organizations to patch five known vulnerabilities that U.S. officials said were the subject of exploitation by the SVR.\nRiskIQ identified three dozen command and control servers serving WellMess that the company said were under APT29 control.  It focused on the infrastructure after a U.S.-Russia summit where cyberattacks came up.\n“The activity uncovered was notable given the context in which it appeared, coming on the heels of a public reproach of Russian hacking by President Biden in a recent summit with President Putin,” RiskIQ’s Team Atlas said.\nCozy Bear is not publicly accused of taking part in any recent ransomware attacks, which were the subject of the White House’s dialogue with the Russian government. The group has differentiated itself by conducting cyber-espionage against targets such as the federal contractor SolarWinds and the Democratic National Committee.\nHow the Russian spies are now using the WellMess malware remains a mystery to RiskIQ.\n“Readers should note that much of this infrastructure is still in active use by APT29, though we do not have enough information to say how it is being used or who the targets are,” the company said.\nBiden has been pressuring Putin, both directly and in public remarks, to curtail malicious cyber activity originating in Russia, particularly ransomware attacks thought to be carried out by criminal organizations. A call between the two men followed a string of high-profile ransomware attacks with alleged Russian origins, most recently on hundreds of victims stemming from an incident at the software firm Kaseya.\n“I made it very clear to him that the United States expects, when a ransomware operation is coming from his soil even though it’s not sponsored by the state, we expect them to act if we give them enough information to act on who that is,” Biden told reporters about the call.\nMore recently, Biden told intelligence personnel in a speech this week that if the U.S. ends up in a “shooting war” with a major foreign power, it will mostly likely come in response to a cyber breach.",
  "Close Military Encounters Are Message From Russia to the West",
  "A leading-edge research firm focused on digital transformation.\n\n                Good\n                \n\n\nSubscriber\nAccount active\n                since\n                \n\nWith close military encounters on opposite sides of the world, Russia is sending a message to the West\nClose encounters between Russia's military and US and European forces in June were signals from Moscow to its rivals about its capabilities and how it was willing to use them, experts said this month.\nOn June 23, Russian combat aircraft flew over the British destroyer HMS Defender as it conducted an \"innocent passage\" in the Black Sea near Crimea.\nRussia said it fired warning shots and dropped bombs near the warship, which the UK denied, though the British defense minister said Russian jets performed maneuvers that were \"neither safe nor professional.\"\nIn the same area a day later, Russian jets repeatedly flew close to Dutch frigate HNLMS Evertsen while conducting mock attacks, creating what the Dutch Defense Ministry called \"a dangerous situation.\"\nEvertsen's commander said it was in international waters, and that the Russian actions were \"irresponsible and unsafe.\"\nThose incidents have \"a larger message,\" said Matthew Rojansky, the director of the Wilson Center's Kennan Institute.\n\"Moscow is increasingly willing and able to enforce what it sees as territorial and operational red lines, and Crimea and the Black Sea are a major focus of attention,\" Rojansky said.\nTensions remain high after Russia's 2014 seizure of Crimea from Ukraine, and Moscow has sought to \"set the precedent\" that it controls its territorial claims there, Rojansky said, citing the 2018 Kerch Strait incident.\n\"All this traces back to Putin's words in March 2014, when he justified the Russian seizure of Crimea as being about keeping NATO out,\" Rojansky added.\nRussia's military drilled around Crimea throughout the end of June and early July, focusing on attacking the ships of \"a notional enemy.\" The US- and Ukrainian-led exercise Sea Breeze also kicked off in late June and was the largest iteration in its 21-year history, with 32 countries participating.\nMoscow described Sea Breeze as \"openly anti-Russian,\" but US and NATO officials stressed that it was defensive in nature and done in accordance with international law.\n\"It's one of the most robust Sea Breeze exercises we've conducted to date, and we're proud of that,\" the chief Pentagon spokesperson, John Kirby, said on July 6.\nThe Black Sea incidents also overlapped with Russian and British-led exercises in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea.\nBritish aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth, sailing with US F-35B fighter jets aboard, conducted exercises and combat operations against ISIS during the final days of June.\nUS and British jets found themselves in a \"cat and mouse\" game with Russia, which angled to keep an eye on them as Russian warships and aircraft conducted reconnaissance and air-defense drills.\nTheir proximity was not a coincidence, said Michael Kofman, the research program director in the Russia Studies Program at CNA.\nRussia has deployed more forces to its improved military facilities in Syria, while the UK is putting HMS Queen Elizabeth, its newest carrier, through real-world testing during its maiden deployment.\n\"A force-on-force interaction that's not planned is probably one of the best ways to generate these kind of lessons and experience for the Royal Navy,\" Kofman said on a recent podcast. He added that Russia used the British deployment as an opportunity to \"train strike missions against NATO ships.\"\nMid-June also saw a major Russian exercise in the central Pacific Ocean, with warships and aircraft conducting what Russian officials called their largest exercise there since the Cold War.\nMuch of their activity was hundreds of miles from Hawaii, but US officials said some Russian ships came within 30 nautical miles of the islands.\nRussian long-range-bomber operations during the exercise twice prompted US F-22 fighters to scramble for potential intercepts, though US officials said Russian aircraft never came close to Hawaii. (US and Russian aircraft regularly intercept each other over the Pacific.)\nThe exercise was \"unprecedented\" in its size and its distance from Russia, said Carl Shuster, a retired US Navy captain who was director of operations at US Pacific Command's Joint Intelligence Center in the 1990s.\n\"The Soviet Navy never conducted exercises this close to the Hawaiian Islands,\" Shuster said.\n\"The Russian political statement was, 'We've returned as a Pacific maritime power and can reach your territory just as you are reaching ours in the Black Sea,'\" Shuster added. \"The target audience of course was the Russian people and the American leadership.\"\nThe Pacific exercise — which took place around the Biden-Putin summit in Switzerland — was also a demonstration of military capability, featuring what Moscow called \"the tasks of detecting, countering and delivering missile strikes against an aircraft carrier strike group.\"\nThe ships involved included the guided-missile cruiser Varyag, Russia's Pacific Fleet flagship, and the destroyer Marshal Shaposhnikov, which carries Kalibr missiles, a weapon that worries US commanders and \"presented the potential military threat that gave the message credibility,\" Shuster said.\nUS military forces \"remain ready and present in the Indo-Pacific,\" said Lt. Col. Martin Meiners, a Pentagon spokesperson. He called it the US's \"priority theater.\"\nThe Russian warships that conducted the Pacific exercise returned to port earlier this month, but encounters between Russian and NATO forces in the Black Sea and the Pacific have continued. Russian officials continue to call the HMS Defender incident a \"provocation\" and warn about future run-ins.\n\"Russia will continue to foil such actions using the harshest methods, regardless of the nationality of the violator,\" Mikhail Popov, the deputy secretary of Russia's Security Council, said this week."
